PR proposes an own JSON-like grammar for KeY settings and configuration.  \r\n\r\n## Status Quo\r\n\r\nCurrently, we store our settings inside of Java Properties files. Either for global settings inside `$HOME/.key` or inside of proof files. Java Properties are a simple and easy solution, but also have some disadvantages. For example, \r\n\r\n* the lack of type safety (everything is a string), \r\n* missing positional information (we are not able to give error messages regarding incorrect settings), \r\n* no support for adding comments, and \r\n* no complex data structures. \r\n\r\n## Proposal \r\n\r\nI propose an own grammar, written an ANTLR4, for KeY's configuration that is compatible with JSON and the grammar of KeY.  \r\n\r\n### Why an own grammar? (or why not JSON, TOML or Co.)\r\n\r\nThere are many popular grammars for configuration files, e.g., JSON, TOML and YAML. I decided against them for the following reason:\r\n\r\n* The grammar must be embeddable into our KeY files and grammar. \r\n* No external dependencies and complexity. The grammar is small, and parsing is done in a few hundred boring LoC. \r\n* No support for storing additional information, like comments. \r\n\r\n### The grammar\r\n\r\nThe grammar is an extension of JSON, allowing comments, multiline strings, non-quoted keys, etc. An example is given in the comments below. \r\n\r\nThe grammar is a recursive definition of values, which can simply be expressed as an ANTLR4 grammar.\r\n\r\n```antlr4\r\n// Config\r\ncfile: cvalue*;\r\nckv: doc=DOC_COMMENT? ckey ':' cvalue;\r\nckey: IDENT | STRING_LITERAL;\r\ncvalue:\r\n    IDENT #csymbol\r\n  | STRING_LITERAL #cstring\r\n  | BIN_LITERAL #cintb\r\n  | HEX_LITERAL #cinth\r\n  | MINUS? INT_LITERAL #cintd\r\n  | FLOAT_LITERAL #cfpf\r\n  | DOUBLE_LITERAL #cfpd\r\n  | REAL_LITERAL #cfpr\r\n  | (TRUE|FALSE) #cbool\r\n  | LBRACE\r\n     (ckv (COMMA ckv)*)? COMMA?\r\n    RBRACE #table\r\n  | LBRACKET (cvalue (COMMA cvalue)*)? RBRACKET #986 \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n1. Settings inside proof files would no longer be strings instead the section follows the grammar above.\r\n2. All configuration files inside `$HOME/.key` will follow the new grammar. In case of the presence of a properties or and JSON file, the JSON takes advantage. \r\n3. The interface for settings (`#writeSettings` and `#readSettings`) is extended with two new methods which take an object of `Configuration` (which is an extended `Map<String, Object>`) instead of a `Properties` object.\r\n\r\n### Migration strategies\r\n\r\nIn KeY files, we decide, based on the grammar (STRING_LITERAL vs. JSON-object), which settings handling should be to trigger. All settings are written as JSON-objects.

is an expanded version of https://git.key-project.org/key/key/-/merge_requests/562.\r\n\r\nOriginal description, modified with additional changes:\r\n\r\nSaves the name of the SMT solver that was able to close a goal in the proof file (and take it into account when loading).\r\nAlso saves the unsat core reported by the SMT solver (currently only enabled for Z3).\r\n\r\n# Why\r\nWhen a goal is closed by applying an SMT solver result, at the moment the solver that was able find an `unsat` result is not saved in the proof. In the saved file, the corresponding line looks like this:\r\n```\r\n    (builtin \"SMTRule\")\r\n```\r\nWhen the proof is reloaded, the SMT solvers are run again. However, when multiple solvers are installed, it is unclear, which of them is used. I think it depends on the current user settings, i.e. the file `proofIndependentSettings.proofs` in the `.key` folder, but I am not sure, as changing the key `[SMTSettings]ActiveSolver` did not produce reliable results on my machine.\r\n\r\n## Further Note\r\nWith this MR, when I load the proof `key.ui/examples/heap/verifyThis17_1_PairInsertionSort/sort.proof.gz` (which currently experiences a timeout on Jenkins, see !558), for replay the Z3 solver is selected instead of CVC5, which decreases the loading time from 15 minutes to under 10 minutes on my machine. So while not solving the root cause of the problem, it may also help with timeout.\r\n\r\n# Feature\r\n* The name of the successful solver and the formulas in the unsat core are stored in the proof file, for example:\r\n```\r\n    (builtin \"SMTRule\" (ifInst \"\"  (formula \"7\")) (ifInst \"\"  (formula \"3\")) (ifInst \"\"  (formula \"2\")) (ifInst \"\"  (formula \"1\")) (solverType \"Z3\"))\r\n```\r\n* When reloading, a solver with the given name is searched for in the available solvers. If available, this one is taken. Otherwise the current default solver is used (Z3).\r\n* If no solverType is specified (legacy proofs), the replay is tried with Z3. It probably has the highest chance to work, most likely the proof was originally done with Z3, since for a long time we only supported this solver.\r\n* [x] There is a switch to completely disable SMT proof search during proof reloading (shows a warning).\r\n\r\n# Open and possible tasks for the future\r\n* [ ] When multiple solvers are run, at least one of them has to return `unsat`, others may return `unknown` for the result to be applicable and close the goal. Currently, for saving one of the solvers that returned `unsat` is selected, but I do not know according to which criteria (probably the one that first appears in the solver union). For the future, the fastest one should be selected.\r\n* [ ] In addition to saving the solver name, we could also save branch specific settings, for example the timeout or some specific options for the solvers (e.g., translation without type hierarchy).","created_at":"2023-03-22T10:50:43Z","updated_at":"2023-05-11T15:24:02Z","closed_at":"2023-05-11T15:24:02Z","merged_at":"2023-05-11T15:24:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"6a929470ef499d0331f85df1bae1a5384116ec49","assignee":{"login":"FliegendeWurst","id":12560461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTYwNDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12560461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst","html_url":"https://github.com/FliegendeWurst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"FliegendeWurst","id":12560461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTYwNDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12560461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst","html_url":"https://github.com/FliegendeWurst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FliegendeWurst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4940939276,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIpmSbc8AAAABJoDADA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/labels/Proof%20Loading/Saving","name":"Proof

MR brings overloaded operators to KeY lang:\r\n\r\n1. On function and predicate definitions you can additional add prefix, infix, and postfix notations.\r\n   ```\r\n   \\functions {\r\n     int add(int, int) \\infix(+);\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   These information are stored inside the `Function` object. \r\n\r\n2. These information also impacts the pretty printing.\r\n \r\n3. Operators are now a sequence of symbols `[-+*/^<>=|]`. Their first character determines the precedence. Following are legal expressions:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n     a ++ b + c  = ( a ++ b ) + c\r\n     a <|> b <= c \r\n     a +- b != a + -b\r\n   ```\r\n  This trick avoids an \"operator precedence parser\", which would also be nice.

Proof Collection Parser is an antlr3 parser, which reads text files -- the proof collections -- and translates them into a data structure used for executing *run all proofs* tests. In order of switching from antlr3 to antlr4, it seems that rewriting of this parser is not beneficial, as its grammar can easily mapped to a Java-DSL without loss of readability and gaining all nice IDE features (syntax highlighting, code assist etc) for writing these files. \r\n\r\n:exclamation: So this PR removes the collection and also all dependencies of ANTLR2 and ANTLR3 in the source code of KeY. \r\n\r\nSides effects are that unused exception classes are removed. \r\n\r\nThis PR also repairs wrong paths of Information flow statistics and adds the run-all-proofs to the uploaded build artifacts.\r\n\r\nThe impact is limited to run all proofs. This MR also changes the path, where the statistics are written to---in particular the folder `key.core.test` does not exists anymore; leading to changes in the Jenkins

of https://git.key-project.org/key/key/-/merge_requests/596. All review comments have been adressed.\r\n______________________\r\n\r\nThis branch introduces the proof analysis and slicing algorithms implemented for my bachelor's thesis for inclusion in the next KeY version.\r\n\r\n# Why? \r\n\r\nNeat data structure (dependency graph) and algorithm that help many usecases: \"optimizing\" the loading time of finished proofs, investigating the efficiency of KeY's heuristics, reducing the size of incomplete proofs, ...\r\n\r\nAlso see https://git.key-project.org/key/key-docs/-/merge_requests/7\r\n\r\n# Features and Impact\r\n\r\nMany new features available in the GUI: inspecting the dependency graph of a proof, proof analysis, proof slicing, ...\r\n \r\nThe build script has been changed to save the full git commit hash as KeY version.\r\n\r\n## Changes in key.core\r\n\r\n- new `EqualsModProofIrrelevancy` interface to ignore certain details when comparing objects across proofs (currently only origin labels)\r\n- `Node`: `stepIndex` and `branchLocation`\r\n- `BranchLocation` class to represent a location in the proof tree\r\n- `KeYMediator`: `fireProofLoaded` event (called just before a loaded proof is replayed)\r\n- `ProofSaver`: option to only save the proof obligation\r\n- `OneStepSimplifier`: when reloading a proof, restrict the formulas available to the Simplifier to the previously used formulas\r\n- `Taclet`: `addedBy` field to indicate which proof step defined a taclet\r\n- `ModularSMTLib2Translator`, `SMTFocusResults`: new facilities to ask the SMT solver for an unsat core and hide formulas not present in the unsat core from the sequent\r\n\r\n## Changes in key.util\r\n- `Graph`, `DirectedGraph`, `GraphEdge`, `DefaultEdge`: simple implementation of a directed graph\r\n\r\n# Review\r\n\r\nThe most \"interesting\" class to review is probably SlicingProofReplayer, since some parts of it are very similar to the IntermediateProofReplayer.\r\n\r\n# Persons involved\r\n\r\nCommit c9f59aeba25cde9f9db4fc608e99f235575377bc by Mattias Ulbrich (experiments with SMT unsat cores) is included in this branch. It was only intended as a \"temporary hack\", but it proved to be quite useful and has been adapted slightly to handle SMT solvers that do not produce unsat cores.\r\n________________________\r\n\r\nComment edited by @WolframPfeifer: Attached the original

PR adds the newly introduced JML names for entities to KeY. Such labels are exploited inside the KeY's proof tree as branching labels. And may later become accessible in proof scripts.\r\n\r\nThis MR brings following changes:\r\n\r\n* JML entities have names:\r\n  ```java\r\n  //@ invariant NAME: true;\r\n  //@ ensures<h1> NAME: true;\r\n  //@ behavior NAME: requires NAME1: true; \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* `lbl` function is supported, e.g., `\\lbl(NAME, x != y)`\r\n\r\n* A new term label `name(XXX)` is added, where \"XXX\" holds the name given in the JML specification. \r\n\r\n* Terms that are created by the JMLParser/Translator receive a this term label if the entity has a name or a `\\lbl` was given. \r\n\r\n* Change to the KeY parser: Goal templates can have computed labels. \r\n\r\n  Currently, the label of a goal can be a schema variable or static string. With this MR you are allowed to define labels which are computed by a Java interface `BranchNamingFunction`. \r\n  A taclet exploits this in the following way:\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  andRight {\r\n      \\find (==> b & c)\r\n      \"\\nameLabelOf(b)\":\\replacewith(==> b);\r\n      \"\\nameLabelOf(c)\":\\replacewith(==> c)\r\n      \\heuristics(beta)\r\n  };\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  New branching naming functions can be added by an interface. The `\\nameLabelOf` tries to find a `f«name(X)»` term label, and returns `X`. It fallbacks to the origin term label and then to the toString representation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TODO \r\n\r\n* [x] Better branch names for `origin` label\r\n* [x] Test function for the introduction of abbreviations on sequent based on name label.\r\n* [x] Discuss impact on proof scripts. Extend proofs scripts with abbreviation variable? `@post_abc`?\r\n* [x] `andRightX` and `orLeftX` per Built-In rule?\r\n---\r\n\r\n### KeY example (working)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\\sorts { s; }\r\n\\predicates {\tp; \tq; }\r\n\\problem {\r\n  (p<<name(\"A\")>> -> q<<name(\"B\")>>) -> !q<<name(\"C\")>> -> !p<<name(\"D\")>>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104259/216825901-cbe6bc91-fe49-49fa-869a-400626cec0c0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nNew rules `andRightX` (for $x \\in 3..6$) allows a more comprehensible proof split. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104259/226412328-e893721c-ac18-4477-87a1-c0f81cf51a2d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### JML\r\n\r\nConsider following examples: \r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Test {\r\n    //@ public invariant MY_SUPER_INVARIANT: CONST == 42;\r\n\r\n    public final int CONST = 42;\r\n    /*@\r\n    requires Z: this != null;\r\n    ensures A: \\result == 42;\r\n    ensures B: \\result >= 0;\r\n    ensures C: \\result != 0;\r\n    */\r\n    public int foo() {return CONST;}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results into the following proof tree. At places where no name label is available we ask the origin label for a string representation. The origin label needs further improvement e.g., line numbers :exclamation: \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104259/226410449-4bbee03c-75f5-4f0d-895d-a8aeb6009a49.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sum And Max\r\n```\r\nclass SumAndMax {\r\n\r\n    int sum;\r\n

PR removes the hand-written parser for proof scripts and uses a few rules in `KeYParser.g4` instead.\r\n\r\nSince the start of proof scripts, the KeYParser has changed and became an ANTLR4 grammar. This allows us to easily write a grammar for our proof scripts. (Or just copy the few rules from Sarah and mine proof script parser). This eliminates the handwritten proof script parser with the following benefits:\r\n\r\n1. Proof Scripts are a first-class citizen in KeY files. You do not need to put your proof script into a string literal:\r\n   ```\r\n   \\proofscript {\r\n       andLeft;\r\n       andRight;  \r\n       rule a ==> b;\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n   \r\n   Please note an ambiguity in the grammar: `rule b ==> c` could either be interpreted as a command with one or two arguments: \r\n   1.  a semi-sequent `b ==>` and a term `c`, or \r\n   2. a sequent ` b ==> c`.\r\n   3. or a term `b` and a semi-sequent `==> c`.\r\n   \r\n   Use quotes or (better) parentheses to clarify these situations.\r\n  \r\n   The grammar should follow the KeY grammar as best as possible. Backwards-compatibility is tried to preserve.\r\n\r\n2. Earlier and better syntax errors, during reading of the KeY file instead of proof script execution. \r\n\r\n4. Better positioning information, as these are generated by using the `ParseContext`s.\r\n\r\n5. Proper data structure: no triple of strings is pushed through KeY. \r\n\r\n6. You do not need to put your arguments in quotes. Literals, terms and sequents are parsed. \r\n\r\n### Breaking Change \r\n\r\n* The following is now prohibited: \r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   my-command x;\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   Commands should be valid KeY identifiers, hence they should be free of dashes (aka subtraction operation). \r\n\r\n* Single quotes are reserved for character literals. Please only use `\"`. \r\n\r\n### Backward compatibility\r\n\r\nTried to achieve backward-compatibility. \r\n\r\n1. The proof script can still be given as a string: `\\proofscript \"...\";` inside a KeY file. \r\n\r\n2. Term arguments can still be given as a string. The conversion mechanism are still in place to convert the data types in many directions (string to int, string to term, but also term to string, etc.)\r\n\r\n   Note there is a difference between `\\`f(x)\\`` and `\"f(x)\"`. The first one is parsed directly as a term and can only be passed to term or string arguments (or any other data type for which a converter is registered). The second one `\"f(x)\"` is parsed as a string. By meta-information on commands, the string is lazily converted to a term if necessary. This conversion is delayed until the command execution. \r\n\r\n   The term `f(x)` might be parsed early with the input file, but the expression is evaluated (translated from parse tree to `Term`) on command-execution time, hence, the use of goal-local variables should be possible.\r\n\r\n## Side changes  to Proof Scripts \r\n\r\n## \"Higher-order proof scripts\"\r\n\r\nA proof command can receive a block of commands as  an argument. Consider this: \r\n\r\n```\r\ntry { auto; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `try` is a regular proof command. And `{ auto; }` is a block. This constructs replace `tryclose;` but gives you more power on what will be tried. \r\n\r\nThis feature arose by the current complicated version of the `AllCommand` (e.g., `onAll hide \\`f(x)\\``) executes the sub-command specified by the arguments on all goals). In SaG scripts we used `foreach { ... }` to achieve this behavior. \r\n\r\nThe extension adapts the command syntax to take a list of sub-commands in curly brackets.\r\n\r\n```antlr\r\nproofScriptCommand: \r\n    name  args  (  '{'   <sub-command>  '}' ';'? | ';' )\r\n    ; \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new syntax for `onAll` is also `onAll { hide \\`f(x)\\`; }`. Commands receive the code block using the key `#block` inside the map as a parse tree, that can be sent back to the `ScriptEngine` using `#execute(state, statements)`.  The new syntax allows building new commands like \r\n\r\n- `try {<sub>}` -- executes `<sub>` ignoring errors\r\n- `repeat { <sub> }` -- executes `<sub>` as long as there are changes on the sequent. \r\n- `matching <term> { <sub> }` -- execute on all goals where `<term>` is prescense. \r\n\r\n### Removal of the XML for command documentation. \r\n\r\nWe used an XML file to store documentation of proof script commands. This file was deleted, and we use text block literals instead. \r\n\r\n### Remove of `@`-prefix\r\n\r\n* [ ] TODO

MR implements the spec math modes discussed in a recent KaKeY meeting. See [here](https://github.com/KeYProject/key/wiki/Spec-math-modes) for a reference. Furthermore, safe math is implemented using the wd checker, this mode generates additional in bounds checks when doing a wd proof and is otherwise treated like the bigint mode.\r\n\r\nThe *code* overflow behaviour remains unchanged and is to be overhauled in a later MR. This MR only includes the changes to specification translation.\r\n\r\nTests do exists
