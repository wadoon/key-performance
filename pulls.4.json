first started, KeY uses the Java cross-platform look-and-feel called Metal. But opening the settings dialog automatically selects the System look-and-feel as default.\r\n\r\nThus, when installing KeY on a platform that provides a system look-and-feel, you will see the Metal LnF at first, but as soon as you generate a settings file by opening the settings dialog, KeY will switch to the System LnF even if you don't select anything.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by always

draft PR fixes a bug where updates are dropped even though they would have an effect. This happens since the DropEffectlessElementariesCondition performs the check using a LinkedHashSet, which relies on equals of LocationVariable. However, this is not implemented and defaults to equals of Object.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I do not know why this bug only appears after pruning in the proof. Directly after opening/loading the instances of LocationVariable are the same, thus the check succeeds and the update is not dropped ...\r\n\r\nSince the change might have a big impact, let's see if the tests run

PR finally brings the proof management tool to the main branch (development started at the HacKeYthon in 2018!). The description of the features can be found in the Readme (also added below for convenience).\r\n\r\n# Impact on key.core/key.ui\r\n* For the dependency check, it is necessary to know under which modality a contract was applied in a proof. Therefore, this information is saved in the proofs from now on. Note that for legacy proofs without saved modality, the dependency check assumes that the contracts have been applied under diamond modality (sound, but may lead to false positives).\r\n* For performance reasons, there is a flag \"deleteIntermediateTree\" which can be set to false to allow reuse of the intermediate representation built during proof replay (this avoids double work in the proof management). For calls from KeY, the flag is always set to true, which keeps the old behavior.\r\n* The CommandLine class has been extended to support subcommands (pm check, pm merge, ...) with their own sets of options and arguments.\r\n* The check command can be called via a GUI extension to make it more visible to the users.\r\n\r\n# Proof Management (copied from the Readme)\r\n\r\nThis project contains a proof management tool for KeY proofs. It can be used as a stand-alone program via its console\r\ninterface or as a GUI extension for KeY.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nWhen verifying Java source code with JML specifications, it is standard that multiple methods with multiple\r\ncontracts must be proven. However, due to memory and time constraints, the corresponding proofs are often not conducted\r\nduring a single run of KeY. Furthermore, it is frequently the case that the source has to be re-loaded multiple times in\r\nKeY between two proofs, since changes had to be made, for example, to the specification of the methods.\r\n\r\nWith this workflow it is crucial to have some form of proof management, since it is very difficult for the user to\r\nmanually track all changes and detect the proofs that have to be re-conducted after a change in the source code.\r\nKeY comes with a built-in proof management that partially solves the problem. However, this internal proof management\r\nhas a few shortcomings:\r\n1) It only considers the proofs currently loaded in the GUI. This is often not really helpful, since usually it is not a\r\n   good idea to have too many proofs loaded at the same time (memory restrictions).\r\n2) It only considers proofs loaded in the same environment (via \"File\" -> \"Proof Management\"), which is an option that\r\n   is not obvious to many users. Furthermore, if the source code changes, a new environment is (and has to be, for \r\n   soundness reasons) created.\r\n3) The current proof management does not check for compatible settings (overflows, different integer semantics, runtime\r\n   exceptions, ...).\r\n4) Some dependencies are not checked by KeY, for example cycles involving model methods or dependency contracts.\r\n\r\nThe intention of this project is to provide a tool that can check a proof bundle (a directory or zip file that contains\r\nsource code and a collection of proofs) for consistency.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nThe proof management tool contains the following features:\r\n* **MissingProofsChecker:** Detects contracts (in the user-provided source code) that have no proof. Note that only\r\n  unproven contracts from inside the `src` folder are reported (not from the cp or bcp folders, see below).\r\n* **SettingsChecker:** Detects incompatible taclet settings (called `Choices` internally in KeY) between the proofs of a\r\n  bundle. An example of this would be that one proof is conducted using mathematical integer semantics and another one\r\n  with Java integers.\r\n* **ReplayChecker:** Detects proofs that can not be replayed, for example because they were conducted with an old KeY\r\n  version or because the proof file was edited manually and contains syntax errors.\r\n* **DependencyChecker:** Detects proofs that contain unproven dependencies (i.e., rely on contracts that are unproven).\r\n  In addition, the dependency checker reports illegal cyclic dependencies between proofs, for example if two mutually\r\n  recursive methods contain wrong `measured_by` clauses and are proven separately with KeY (and thus the bundle contains two proofs that are both correctly closed per se).\r\n* **HTML report:** Besides the plain text messages on the console, an HTML report can be generated that contains the\r\n  console messages in a filterable format, lists contracts, proofs, and shows their corresponding status.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n### Stand-alone Program (CLI)\r\n```\r\nUsage: pm <command> [<options>...] [<args>...]\r\n  available commands:\r\n    check: Checks a single proof bundle for consistency.\r\n    merge: Merges multiple proof bundles.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### check\r\nThe `check` command performs the selected consistency checks and is able to give a console or HTML report:\r\n```\r\npm check [--missing] [--settings] [--replay] [--dependency] [--report <out_path>] <bundle_path>\r\n```\r\nThe available options correspond to the features described in the section above.\r\n`<bundle_path>` is the path of the proof bundle to check and can either denote a directory or a zip file.\r\n\r\nThe directory structure of the bundle has to conform that described in\r\n[classpath documentation](https://key-project.org/docs/user/Classpath/).\r\nAn example of a (zipped) proof bundle would be:\r\n```\r\nbundle.zproof\r\n  - src            // java classes (.java files only)\r\n    - A.java\r\n    - mypackage\r\n      - B.java\r\n      - C.java\r\n  - classpath      // optional: classpath (may contain .jar files and subdirectories\r\n                   //           with .java and/or .class files)\r\n    - someLibrary.java\r\n    - otherLibrary\r\n      - Lib.java\r\n      - Util.class\r\n  - bootclasspath  // optional: bootclasspath (system classes from the Java class library),\r\n                   //           replaces the files shipped with KeY\r\n    - java\r\n      - lang\r\n        - Math.java\r\n        - String.java\r\n        - System.java\r\n        ...\r\n      - math\r\n      ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### merge\r\nThe `merge` command merges multiple bundles in zip or directory format into a single one.\r\n```\r\npm merge [--force] [--check \"<check_args>\"] <bundle1> <bundle2> ... <output>\r\n```\r\nMerging fails when two or more of the input bundles contain files with the same name (at the same path), but different\r\ncontent. This can be the case if for example different versions of the Java code were used for the proofs. To merge\r\nnonetheless, the `--force` flag can be set. In this case, the resulting bundle will contain the versions from the first\r\ngiven bundle.\r\n\r\nAs a shortcut, the command has a `--check` option which performs the check command on the resulting bundle after the\r\nmerge and forwards the given arguments to that command.\r\n\r\n### KeY GUI Extension\r\nThe project adds the `Proof Management` menu to KeY. It currently contains only a single entry which opens a dialog to\r\nconfigure the checkers to run and the path for the HTML report to generate. After a successful run, the HTML report is\r\nopened in the system's default browser.\r\n\r\n## Known Problems / Missing features\r\nSome features are currently not implemented:\r\n* It is not checked that user-defined rules (taclets included in user-provided .key files) are proven.\r\n* For the SettingsChecker, taclet settings have to be exactly identical at the moment, which could probably be relaxed a\r\n  bit in the future.\r\n* An `--auto` flag could be added for the `check` command, which tries to proof contracts without explicit proofs\r\n  automatically. There could also be an option to save these automatically found proofs into the bundle.\r\n* There could be a `bundle` command that creates a proof bundle by creating the required file structure based on the\r\n  information provided in a `.key` file.

See also there for an extensive discussion on the subject.**\r\n\r\n### Constructors\r\n\r\nThis mechanism *must not* be used when verifying a constructor or if constructors are planned to be inlined. In these cases, final field are writable. We suggest to implement this mechanism with a taclet option such that it can be switched off -- or even switched off automatically if need be.\r\n\r\n### Example \r\nThis file that can be closed automatically with this encoding. It cannot be closed in KeY itself since the `final` modifier is not considered in KeY.\r\n\r\n[A.java](/uploads/22b8bcda0ebb058c8cedfec76861d71a/A.java)\r\n\r\n### Remaining issues\r\n\r\nThis is work in progress. There may be parts of KeY where this change has unexpected consequences.\r\n\r\n* [ ] Make it a taclet option\r\n* [ ] Add documentation to new methods\r\n* [ ] OPTIONAL: Adapt welldefined checking. @mi-ki \r\n* [ ] OPTIONAL: Add a class `FinalArray<T>` which allows this for arrays too (well ...) \r\n\r\nSide note: The variable condition `\\final` has already been implemented by Daniel, but was not used till now.

branch implements `assignable_free` clauses, which akin to `ensures_free` allow you to specify frame conditions that the caller can assume but the callee does not have to prove. See #3185.\r\n\r\n`assignable_free` clauses are implemented for functional method contracts, functional block/loop contracts, and loop invariants.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Semantics\r\n\r\nConsider the following example.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/*@ public normal_behavior\r\n  @ ensures field == 21; */\r\nvoid foo() {\r\n  field = 21;\r\n  bar();\r\n}\r\n\r\n/*@ public normal_behavior\r\n  @ ensures true; \r\n  @ assignable \\nothing;\r\n  @ assignable_free field; */\r\nvoid bar() {\r\n  field = 42;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth contracts are provable: The proof obligation for `bar()` must show that only `field` is modified, but then when `bar()` is called from `foo()`, `foo()` assumes that `bar()` modifies `\\nothing`.\r\n\r\nIn general, the caller assumes that the callee only modifies the locations mentioned in its `assignable` clause(s), while the callee must prove that it only modifies the locations in **the union of its `assignable` and `assignable_free` clauses**.

now, KeY could only evaluate the functions `binaryAnd`, `binaryOr`, and\r\n`binaryXOr` for literal values or in cases where a special case taclet exists\r\n(see file \"binaryLemmas.key\"). For general reasoning, this is insufficient.\r\nThis pull request adds new definition taclets for these functions using a new\r\nhelper function `bitAt` to extract individual bits from unbounded JavaDL ints.\r\n\r\nOverview of the taclets added:\r\n- Bit extraction helper function `bitAt`\r\n- `binaryAndDef`, `binaryAndIntDef`, `binaryAndLongDef`\r\n- `binaryOrDef`, `binaryOrIntDef`, `binaryOrLongDef`\r\n- `binaryXOrDef`, `binaryXOrIntDef`, `binaryXOrLongDef`\r\n\r\nUsing the `bitAt` function, we define `binaryAnd`, `binaryOr`, and `binaryXOr`\r\nmathematically as bounded sums over all positional values of the result,\r\ndepending on the results of the bit operations on the input parameters.\r\nWe include three variants of each function definition: One general one where\r\nthe user must specify the maximum sign bit index of the two parameters; one for\r\nJava `int` parameters (sign bit index 31); and one for Java `long` parameters\r\n(sign-bit index 63). Each taclet opens another proof branch in\r\nwhich it must be proven that the parameters of the function lie within the\r\nvalid range dictated by the sign bit index (e.g. `inRangeInt(left) &\r\n`inRangeInt(right)` for the Java `int` versions).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Discussion Points**\r\n- The general definition taclets (e.g. `binaryOrDef`) force the user to specify the index of the sign bit. The disadvantage of this approach is that these taclets are not useful for proving properties of the bitwise functions which are independent of bit width, e.g., `\\forall int a; \\forall int b; (binaryOr(a, b) = binaryOr(b, a))`.\r\n- @WolframPfeifer and I have discussed whether it would be better if these taclets did not define the `binaryX` functions, but instead defined the `XJint`/`XJlong` functions. At the moment, these latter functions are simply intermediate functions which are translated into `binaryX`. It seems that the `binaryX` functions are supposed to be treated as fundamental \"mathematical\" bitwise functions, although they assume two's complement representation which is not mathematically based. The `XJint`/`XJlong` functions clearly encode Java integer semantics into the meaning of the function in their name, thus might be the better \"abstraction level\" at which to define these

JML, at the moment it is not possible to write down **as assertion** which heap locations (may) have been altered by the program up to the current location in code. The reason for this is that the sort Field is not available. The clause `assignable <locs>` in a method contract is encoded in JavaDL as follows:\r\n```math\r\n\\begin{align}\r\n\\forall\\ \\text{Field}\\ f. \\forall\\ \\text{java.lang.Object}\\ o&.\\ (o,f) \\in locs\\\\\r\n&\\vee o \\neq \\text{null} \\wedge \\neg o.< created>\\ = TRUE\\\\\r\n&\\vee o.f@newHeap = o.f@oldHeap\r\n\\end{align}\r\n```\r\nThis PR adds a predicate `assignable(Heap, Heap, LocSet)` that has a single taclet that rewrites it exactly into the above expression. The first parameter is the new heap, the second one the old heap. The taclet has a heuristic to be applied by automatic strategy after symbolic execution.\r\n\r\nIn JML, the predicate can be accessed via dl_ escapes. Note that the first heap parameter can be omitted, as KeY automatically adds the heap at the current location (line of the assertion) to it. \r\n\r\nAs an example, consider the following source code:\r\n```java\r\nclass Assignable {\r\n    int f1, f2;\r\n\r\n    //@ ensures true;\r\n    void m() {\r\n        f1 = 5;\r\n        //@ ghost \\dl_Heap h;\r\n        // @ set h = \\dl_heap();                // this gives a parser error: \"heap is not a known function\"\r\n        //@ assume h == \\dl_heap();             // workaround for testing the assertions below\r\n\r\n        //@ assert \\dl_assignable(\\old(\\dl_heap()), \\singleton(f1));\r\n        // equivalent to assertion above, first parameter is automatically added by KeY if missing:\r\n        // @ assert \\dl_assignable(\\dl_heap(), \\old(\\dl_heap(h)), \\singleton(f1));\r\n\r\n        f2 = 7;\r\n        //@ assert \\dl_assignable(h, \\singleton(f2));\r\n\r\n        // equivalent to \"normal\" method assignable clause with \"assignable f1, f2\":\r\n        //@ assert \\dl_assignable(\\old(\\dl_heap()), \\set_union(\\singleton(f1), \\singleton(f2)));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the assertions are provable. However, the automatic strategy is not able to prove the first one, `selectOfStore resp. selectOfStoreEQ` is not applied to o.f@h, I don't know why. If you do this manually, the proof can easily be closed by KeY. I am quite sure that it has nothing to do with this PR, but rather might be a general problem with the strategy

of the KeY grammar to allow the definition of ADTs. \r\n\r\nThe grammar for ADTs follows the typical defintions in KeY. ADTs are defined within a `\\datatypes { ... }` block, and are translated onto the existing infrastructure (Sorts, Functions, Taclets). The grammar is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\\datatypes {\r\n   <name> := <constructor> | ... | <constructor>;\r\n   ...\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere constructor is a function definition `<cname>( <sort> <argName>, ...)`. \r\n\r\nCurrently, three taclets are generated for each datatype definiton:\r\n\r\n1. Axiom taclets that adds the induction as an axiom on the sequence \r\n\r\n$$\r\n\\frac{\r\n(\\forall a \\in ADT.~ \\phi) \\leftrightarrow  \\phi[a/c_1] \\wedge \\ldots \\wedge \\phi[a/c_n] \r\n\\Longrightarrow\r\n}{\r\n\\forall a \\in ADT.~ \\phi[a]\r\n}\r\n$$\r\n\r\n2.

A case distinction taclet\r\n  \r\n   This is a direct consequence of the disjunction $x = c_1 \\vee\\ldots\\vee x = c_n$ resulting from the construction principles of ADTs. This allows us to make a case distinction about the various constructors. Note, the constructor parameters are need to existential bounded. \r\n\r\n$$\r\n\\frac{\r\n\\begin{matrix}\r\n   x = c_1      \\Longrightarrow \\\\\r\n   \\ldots    \\Longrightarrow    \\\\\r\n   x =

to logically group steps in proof.\r\n\r\nTwo main features:\r\n- \"Reorder\" proof steps such that adjacent proof steps modify the same formula (no interweaving of two simplification chains)\r\n- \"Regroup\" proof steps in the proof tree view (UI only)\r\n\r\nTODOs\r\n- [x] Handle pruning correctly after regrouping\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\nThe order of proof steps is determined as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Steps with no inputs (no find / assumes)\r\n2. Steps ordered by the dep. graph data\r\n3. (optional) Step with no input that splits (e.g. `sign_case_distinction`)\r\n\r\nTo order the steps based on the dependency graph a queue of \"available\" graph nodes is managed. This queue is repeatedly iterated through to check for edges (steps) that are applicable. If they aren't the node is added to the end of the queue again.

PR replaces recoder by [javaparser](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser), or more precisely by [key-javaparser](https://github.com/wadoon/key-javaparser). \r\nThe special version has support for `ProofJava`, `SchemaJava` and Java 17+, all in one grammar. \r\n\r\n[Notes on the grammar can be found in the key-docs](https://keyproject.github.io/key-docs/user/JavaGrammar/)\r\n\r\nThis MR requires a complete overhaul of the KeY-Infrastructure.\r\n\r\n**Status:**\r\n\r\n* [x] Migration of KeY/Java transformations from recoder to javaparser \r\n  * [x] Get compile-error free for testing \r\n  * [x] Check `JavaInfo` for unused methods and delete them\r\n  * [x] Testing (wip)\r\n    * Currently there is one transformation example\r\n    * JavaRedux is parsed and translated.\r\n    * Tests for translation from JP-AST to KeY-AST \r\n* [x] Reimplementing the old infrastructure on top of Javaparser\r\n* [x] Tests\r\n  * What to do with `TestProofJavaParser` and `TestSchemaJavaParser`?\r\n  * `TestKeYRecoderMapping`\r\n* [x] Activate the new implementation.

PR brings restructuring of the KeY's grammar `KeYParser.g4`  for more performance.\r\n\r\nSome of the changes are critical as they change the grammar, and need to be discuss.\r\n\r\nThe **current situation** is as follows. All given benchmarks given on our biggest Key-file `javaRules.key`. *Parse time* should be treated carefully, as JIT and caching effects have critical. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-04-15
