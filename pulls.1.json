run for module-info in KeY after the drop of ST4. Builds-upon #3621, should merged afterwards.  \r\n\r\nThis pull request adds module support in KeY by adding `module-info.java` and doing the necessary stuff. There are three main issues with modules in KeY: \r\n\r\n- clashing Java packages (packages are sealed)\r\n  (solved by renaming some packages)\r\n\r\n- Docking Frames is not-modularized \r\n  (Baked a new version, with renamed packages. **This version is on central snapshot repo, and should then be deployed to Maven central)\r\n\r\n- Caching extension in wrong service file\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional: \r\n\r\n- Removal of ANTLR2+3 from KeY. \r\n\r\nHint:\r\n\r\n- Isabelle translation added a Scala library, which breaks the Java module convention, but it seems not to break the JVM module system

Related Issue\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\nSmall change to the GitHub workflow for unit testing. Now, the test matrix is also over each individual module. Therefore, each module is tested separately. \r\n\r\n### Advantages: \r\n\r\n* Easier to spot individual failing modules\r\n* More things in parallel lead to faster failures\r\n* Fine-grained download of individual reports for each module. \r\n\r\n### Disadvantages: \r\n\r\n* Higher CPU usage: KeY is compiled more often \r\n  (Note: artefact sharing between jobs (upload+download) was

`main` into `weigl/key-javaparser3` gets more and more complicated. One reason is the usage of `java.nio.Path` on the `JavaParser` branch.\r\n\r\nThis PR brings the `java.nio.Path` into KeY exhaustively for the following reason:\r\n\r\n* Final goal of `FileRepo` removal and easier handling of proof bundles. \r\n   \r\n  Java NIO supports reading and writing to Zip files directly w/o unzipping as a regular file system. \r\n\r\n* Uniform usage of one file API across KeY. \r\n  \r\n  Currently it is a mess between the old `java.io.File` and `java.nio.Path`.  The latter one supports common functionalities like recursively listing directories or globbing folders.\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\nOn all major places, Java NIO replaces the old Java IO. \r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally change)\r\n- Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n\r\n- I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n- I have tested the feature as follows: test cases\r\n","created_at":"2025-06-03T23:05:24Z","updated_at":"2025-06-06T11:17:20Z","closed_at":"2025-06-06T11:17:19Z","merged_at":"2025-06-06T11:17:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"71bc6c7a16481e6882af1805b61a0355ac77c8d9","assignee":{"login":"wadoon","id":104259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wadoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"wadoon","id":104259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wadoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4940995779,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIpmSbc8AAAABJoGcww","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/labels/%F0%9F%9B%A0%20Maintenance","name":"🛠

The comments can be deleted, but may also \r\nremain since they will be invisible when showing the PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\nThis PR generalizes the taclet matching logic and moves common infrastructure up to ncore.\r\n\r\nIt also improves upon \r\n* cohesion for the VM based program logic as the concerns of match program creation and program interpretation are now separated\r\n* VM instructions are simpler and more focused on one functionality (e.g., cursor placement not convoluted with match instruction; or dynamic case distinctions in match instructions reduced by creating a more specific program for these cases)\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the modularization effort for supporting other target languages.\r\n<!-- Please give a brief description of what behaviour changes and \r\n     why it should be changed. -->\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\n<!-- If this pull request is not yet finished, but has open jobs,\r\n     please list them here.

In particular, we do not enforce different subclasses, e.g., `FindTaclet`, `AntecTaclet`, `RewriteTaclet`. Instead we use a (nullable) `SyntaxElement` for the find expression. This may be a `Term` (e.g., for \"rewrite taclets\") or a `Sequent` (e.g., for antecedent taclets).\r\n\r\nThis PR does not yet move the matching, application, or execution logic. This will be done in a future PR.\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\n<!-- If this pull request is not yet finished, but has open jobs,\r\n     please list them here.

Related Issue\r\n\r\n> NOTE: If you have already migrated your namespace(s) to Maven Central this email does not apply to you and thank you for your initiative.\r\n> \r\n> Greetings OSSRH Publisher,\r\n> \r\n> As you may have heard, OSSRH is reaching end of life on June 30, 2025. OSSRH users need to migrate their namespaces to the Central Portal as soon as possible.\r\n> \r\n> Instructions for self migration are located here: https://central.sonatype.org/faq/what-is-different-between-central-portal-and-legacy-ossrh/#self-service-migration\r\n> \r\n> To make the transition smoother we will be automatically migrating publishers that have not used oss.sonatype.org or s01.sonatype.org to publish artifacts in some time starting with the oldest and working our way forward. To avoid disruption to your publishing processes we strongly encourage migrating before the June 30, 2025 deadline.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you for your assistance,\r\n> \r\n> The Central Team\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\nMake `gradle publish` work again. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\n* Currently, Gradle can not deploy to the new central portal. The legacy support has not worked. The current only way to deploy is:\r\n\r\n  ```sh \r\n  gradle --parallel publishMavenJavaPublicationToLocalRepoRepository\r\n  cd localRepo && zip -9 -r ../localRepo.zip . \r\n  ```\r\n  1. It deploys the maven structure to the folder `localRepo/`\r\n  2. It zips the structure in a correct way. \r\n  3. SNAPSHOTs are not supported, argh...\r\n\r\n  The zip file can be then uploaded to the central portal. \r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- Preventing rotting\r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n\r\n- I upload it to the central portal and it gets validated. Final test only possible with a release.

if SMT solvers are not available during testing, these test cases will be silently ignored---a behavior acceptable on local machines, but not on CI. \r\n\r\nOn CI, this is firstly ensured by executing `z3` and `cvc5` on command-line. This ensures installation, but not that KeY finds the executable. \r\n\r\nThis PR changes the behavior of SMT test cases to failing if SMT solvers are not present, and an additional flag is set.\r\n\r\nThis flag is set iff the environment variables sets `failIfSmtSolverIsUnavailable` or `GITHUB_ACTIONS` to `true`. \r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- New feature (non-breaking change

PR brings FlatLAF as the default LaF for KeY, supporting both light/dark modes.  \r\n\r\nTo make this works, it required cleaning in the current UI code. \r\n\r\nNew (old) rules for UI code: \r\n\r\n1. No stupid default colors like `Color.white` or `Color.black` for foreground/background of UI components. Instead, you should use: `UIManager.getColor(...)` to get the appropriate current color. \r\n2. Every developer-picked color should exist in a dark/light mode variant. \r\n3. UI code needs to be reactive for LaF changes. Either by listening with a `PropertyChangeListener` on the `ViewSettings` or by overriding `Component#updateUI()`. Later, one is triggered after the LaF is set. \r\n4. LaF-dependent objects (like colors, icons) should not be final or static.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad210f46-73a1-4adc-acbd-e563fdad2d1d)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ad9501b-7564-4121-a36d-f3d2b3234395)\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\n* [x] use `SwingUtillities.updateComponentTreeUi` to update the UI after laf switch\r\n* [x] overwrite `Component.updateUI()` if necessary to update the icons. \r\n\r\n* [x] fix settings menu in dark mode:\r\n  \r\n  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf95aa25-85a4-49ff-9d76-9ddb393da86f)\r\n\r\n* [x] Tooltip settings dialog\r\n  \r\n  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3718a929-4a0e-4305-9200-622f7493f898)\r\n\r\n* [x] Proof Tree renderer\r\n  \r\n  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33bb3d56-60ef-49d9-8b1a-17755f0f2ab2)\r\n\r\n\r\n* [x] Testgen window\r\n  \r\n  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a51a093c-992a-49fc-9fd4-3dbb3df35da1)\r\n\r\n* [x] Color for syn. highlighting in Source / Sequent view\r\n\r\n  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fda49cf0-ea05-40a2-b3f3-c6c8dc695b70)\r\n\r\n\r\n* [x] Color settings support for light and dark colors.\r\n\r\n* Not happened: Detecting the current light/dark mode settings from OS. \r\n  * This requires: CLI calls for Linux, registry access on Windows using JNA, or native libs on macOS using JFA. There is a library that encapsulates everything but the deps are too strong. \r\n  \r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n  - removal of hard coded colors in some components \r\n- New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n  - support for dark/light switches (two icon colors, etc.)\r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n- Looking at the UI for a long time.\r\n","created_at":"2025-04-17T13:31:33Z","updated_at":"2025-06-21T20:55:47Z","closed_at":"2025-06-21T20:55:47Z","merged_at":"2025-06-21T20:55:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"9c7d25327cd5d3458383aad4021026b6eafee77c","assignee":{"login":"wadoon","id":104259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wadoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"wadoon","id":104259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wadoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Drodt","id":132357467,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-OdWw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132357467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drodt","html_url":"https://github.com/Drodt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drodt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drodt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drodt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drodt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drodt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drodt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drodt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drodt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Drodt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4940938820,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIpmSbc8AAAABJoC-RA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/labels/GUI","name":"GUI","color":"C5DEF5","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/KeYProject/key/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/milestones/8/labels","id":11825963,"node_id":"MI_kwDOIpmSbc4AtHMr","number":8,"title":"v2.12.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"wadoon","id":104259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wadoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":13,"closed_issues":18,"state":"open","created_at":"2024-10-31T08:54:29Z","updated_at":"2025-06-22T23:46:22Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/pulls/3599/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/pulls/3599/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/issues/3599/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/statuses/6605afe0fbaa3aef

\r\n- [x] I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments): javadoc updated\r\n- [ ] I made sure that new/changed end-user features are well documented (https://github.com/KeYProject/key-docs). Currently none of the user-facing SMT functions are documented\r\n- [ ] I added new test case(s) for new functionality. SMT tests are currently being reworked #3592\r\n- [x] I have tested the feature as follows: Open Aunt Agatha, run SMT preparation, run CVC5, click \"Focus goals\". Hides three formulas.\r\n- [x] I have checked that runtime performance has not deteriorated: unsat core production has been turned on already, printing it should not take long.\r\n\r\n## Additional

Motivation\r\nCurrently, we have a category of SMT test cases (`TestCvc4`, `TestZ3`) which work by loading a .key file with a single formula, for example `\\forall s x; p(x) -> \\exists s y; p(y)`, directly converting it to SMT-LIB, and running a solver.\r\n\r\n These test cases have some problems:\r\n* They can last quite long, since the solver is run into a timeout (expected behavior since the corresponding sequent is not provable). However, since the timeout is set to 5 min per individual test case (hardcoded in SMTTestSettings), the test always takes that time.\r\n* The test cases only use the legacy (aka non-modular) translation.\r\n* The test cases only distinguish two cases: Valid (`unsat` returned by solver), or not (`sat` returned by solver). **However, as it is implemented, the test case also always succeeds if the solver returns `unknown` or runs into a timeout!**\r\n\r\nThe question is: What do we intend with the SMT test cases? My take on this would be:\r\n* We want to detect regressions in our translation(s) of sequents to SMT-LIB.\r\n* We want to have certain smoke tests with simple examples to ensure that the SMT solvers are usable.\r\n* We do not want to test the SMT solvers per se (regressions in the solvers internally).\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\n* Add separate test cases for modular and legacy translation.\r\n* Specify the expected result by the solver more precisely in the test case: Now, `ThreeValuedTruth` is used, so the test cases actually specify whether `unsat`, `sat`, or `unknown`/timeout is expected by the solver.\r\n* Many test cases are expected to have timeouts, so it is crucial to keep the timeout as small as possible such that the tests run through quickly. I changed the settings to 50 sec per individual test case (from 5 min!). That turned out to be enough such that all tests with `unsat` or explicit `unknown` returned easily (on my machine this was always more than four times the time needed, but it needs to be that high since tests run slower on GitHub CI), but still much faster than the current situation, where the test cases block the pipeline for a long time without producing real insights.\r\n* Apart from the functional changes, I also did some refactoring: The parameterized test case is in class `SMTSolverTest` now, the subclasses `Z3Test`, `Z3LegacTest`, ... define the actual parameters by overwriting the abstract method `provideTestData`. This way the test cases are much more concise and readable. \r\n\r\n## Caveats\r\n* Apparently, there is quite a difference in provability between the modular and the legacy translation, i.e. certain sequents can easily be proven in the legacy case, but not with the new translation. Also, I noticed that with the legacy translation, it is possible to get `sat` (i.e., there is a counterexample), which is not possible with the modular translation. But I think that is expected ...\r\n* From our solver infrastructure, it is currently not possible to distinguish between solver timeout and explicit `unknown` returned by the solver. In the future, we might want to separate that to be able to define the expected result more precisely ...\r\n\r\n## Open TODOs\r\n* [ ] ~~More test cases for other solvers (?)~~\r\n* [x] ~~Discussion: Disable the test cases that are expected to run into a timeout?~~ to avoid long waiting, if a timeout is expected the timeout is set to a significantly lower value (2 sec instead of 50 sec at the moment)\r\n* [ ] ~~Discussion: What should happen if a solver is not installed? Skip or fail tests?~~ see #3600\r\n* [ ] ~~Maybe: Do not use hardcoded settings in `SMTTestSettings`, but respect the settings set in the individual file?~~\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- Bug

PR brings a tool for rewriting the settings in KeY files to the new JSON-like format. A requirement to get rid of the old property-based interface. \n\nChanges along the road:\n\n* The KeYLexer can be configured whether `\\proof` is also treated as `EOF` or not. In normal mode, the lexer stops at `\\proof` so that the s-expr of the proof are not going through the parser. \n\n## Plan \n* [ ] Rewrite all KeY files\n\n## Type of pull request\n\n- Refactoring

1.5.18</h2>\n<p><strong>2025-03-18 Release of logback version 1.5.18</strong></p>\n<p>• Added<a href=\"https://logback.qos.ch/manual/appenders.html#fileCompression\"> support for XZ compression</a> for archived log files. Note that XZ compression requires Tukaani project's <a href=\"https://tukaani.org/xz/java.html\">XZ library</a> for Java. In case XZ compression is requested but the XZ library is missing, then logback will substitute GZ compression as a fallback.

1.5.18</strong></p>\n<p>• Added<a href=\"https://logback.qos.ch/manual/appenders.html#fileCompression\"> support for XZ compression</a> for archived log files. Note that XZ compression requires Tukaani project's <a href=\"https://tukaani.org/xz/java.html\">XZ library</a> for Java. In case XZ compression is requested but the XZ library is missing, then logback will substitute GZ compression as a fallback. This feature was requested in issues/755.</p>\n<p>• Removed references to <code>java.security.AccessController</code> class. This class has been deprecated for some time and is slated for removal in future JDK versions.</p>\n<p>• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be reproduced by building from source code at commit b2a02f065379a9b1ba5ff837fc08913b744774bc associated with the tag v_1.5.18.

Synopsis\r\n\r\nJMLScripts and KeY scripts use the same backend, but the ProofScriptEngine is currently bound to the KeY language's parser. This PR introduces a simple AST class to abstract the source of a script, which is a simple record containing the command name, positional and keyword arguments, sub-commands, and positional information. \r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\nclassDiagram\r\n  direction TB\r\n\r\n  class ScriptCommandAst { \r\n  name : String \r\n  positionalArgs : List<Object>\r\n  keywordArgs    : Map<String,Object>\r\n  loc            : Location\r\n }\r\n\r\nScriptCommandAst \"*\" <-- ScriptCommandAst : sub-commands\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlong the road, the interface of script commands is simplified: There is no need for preparing the parameter class instance anymore. Instead, `execute(..)` is called directly and any command implementation can deal with the AST as they like. \r\n\r\nAlso, proof script commands can announce a list of aliases. This allows the implementation of multiple (similar) commands with one implementation. The implementation can adapt its behavior using the given AST representation.\r\n\r\nUsing `List<Object>` and `Map<String,Object>` allows the use within JML scripts, as custom objects can be provided within the AST. Later, the `ValueInjector` should know the conversion rules to get fromthe  custom object to the required types, e.g., how to come from a `JMLTerm` to a `JTerm`.\r\n\r\nBuilds upon: #3021\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\n`ProofScriptEngine` is free of ANTLR classes. \r\nAn AST for the execution of proof scripts exists, which is useable\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\n* [x] Do it.\r\n* [ ] Test it.\r\n* [ ] Ship it.\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally change)\r\n  - **Breaking change**: \r\n    breaks the internal API of proof script execution, and script commands.\r\n\r\n- There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n\r\n- I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n- I made sure that new/changed end-user features are well documented (https://github.com/KeYProject/key-docs).\r\n- I added new test case(s) for new functionality.\r\n- I have tested the

accept an optional dollar sign ('<) before the letter sequence.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that static invariants are represented as `Classname::<$inv>` which one was not able to use in a manual cut.\r\n\r\nBut valid key terms should be parseable.\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\nIt is only a 4 character fix allowing implicit identifiers to start with a `$`.\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- Bug

CMD.exe console when the default terminal application is set to &quot;Windows Console Host&quot;. This problem was reported in issues/753 by Michael Lyubkin.</p>\n<p>• Fixed race condition occurring in case MDC class is initialized while org.slf4j.LoggerFactory is initializing logback-classic's LoggerContext. When this race conditions occurs, the MDCAdapter instance used by MDC does not match the instance used by logback-classic. This issue was reported in SLF4J issues/450. While logback-classic version 1.5.17 remains compatible with SLF4J versions in the 2.0.x series, fixing this particular MDC issue requires SLF4J version 2.0.17.</p>\n<p>• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be reproduced by building from source code at commit 10358724ed723b3745c010aa40cb02a2dfed4593 associated with the tag v_1.5.17.

1.5.17</strong></p>\n<p>• Fixed Jansi 2.4.0 color-coded output not working on Windows CMD.exe console when the default terminal application is set to &quot;Windows Console Host&quot;. This problem was reported in issues/753 by Michael Lyubkin.</p>\n<p>• Fixed race condition occurring in case MDC class is initialized while org.slf4j.LoggerFactory is initializing logback-classic's LoggerContext. When this race conditions occurs, the MDCAdapter instance used by MDC does not match the instance used by logback-classic. This issue was reported in SLF4J issues/450. While logback-classic version 1.5.17 remains compatible with SLF4J versions in the 2.0.x series, fixing this particular MDC issue requires SLF4J version 2.0.17.</p>\n<p>• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be reproduced by building from source code at commit 10358724ed723b3745c010aa40cb02a2dfed4593 associated with the tag v_1.5.17. Release built using Java &quot;21&quot; 2023-10-17 LTS build 21.0.1.+12-LTS-29 under Linux Debian 11.6.</p>\n<h2>Logback 1.5.16</h2>\n<p><strong>2025-01-05 Release of logback version 1.5.16</strong></p>\n<p>• In order to ease the migration of configuration files depending on JaninoEventEvaluator, logback-classic will emit a warning about the removal of JaninoEventEvaluator in version 1.5.13 and suggest an online migration tool.</p>\n<p>• A bit-wise identical binary of this version can be reproduced by building from source code at commit 74c9ebd0e784d9e9ffc6c627cf5016d0157956b2 associated with the tag v_1.5.16.

Intended Change\r\n\r\nThis is a new feature request by users that wanted to use model methods.\r\n\r\nThe PR introduces method bodies that allow some statements. It is limited to\r\n- introducing local variables and variable assignment in method bodies.\r\n- introducing if-statements\r\n- return statements (as they have been there before)\r\n\r\nThis is still rather limited but allows you to structure your code already quite a bit.\r\nThe restrictions are:\r\n- Every if-branch-path must eventually contain a return statement (no phi-nodes)\r\n- Variables must be defined with `var` (due to a restriction in the lexer/parser)\r\n\r\nThe only thing that needs to be done is then to interpret these structures into a term.\r\n\r\nMy running example is the following which explains itself:\r\n``` java\r\nfinal class A {\r\n\r\n    /*@ pure */\r\n    int f(int x) {\r\n        return 40-x;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    /*@ model int maxF(int x, int y) {\r\n      @   var x2 = f(x);\r\n      @   var y2 = f(y);\r\n      @   if(x2 > y2)\r\n      @      return x2;\r\n      @   else {\r\n      @      return y2;\r\n      @   }\r\n      @ }\r\n      @*/\r\n\r\n    /*@ normal_behaviour\r\n      @  ensures maxF(25, 30) == 15;\r\n      @*/\r\n    void test() { }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\n* [x] Implement the feature\r\n* [ ] Make sure we have consensus on wanting this\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n- Other: Changes to JML lexer and parser\r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n   \r\n- [x] I made sure that new/changed end-user features are well documented (https://github.com/KeYProject/key-docs).\r\n- [x] I added new test case(s) for new functionality.\r\n\r\n## Additional information and contact(s)\r\n\r\nThe contributions within this pull request are licensed under GPLv2 (only) for inclusion in KeY.\r\n","created_at":"2025-02-23T21:55:56Z","updated_at":"2025-05-11T17:12:14Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"914084dc4821fdeb648662410f7fbde382202951","assignee":{"login":"mattulbrich","id":17046629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDQ2NjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17046629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich","html_url":"https://github.com/mattulbrich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mattulbrich","id":17046629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDQ2NjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17046629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich","html_url":"https://github.com/mattulbrich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattulbrich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"WolframPfeifer","id":94171076,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZzvxA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94171076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer","html_url":"https://github.com/WolframPfeifer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4940913023,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIpmSbc8AAAABJoBZfw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/labels/JML%20Parser","name":"JML

works now:**\r\n- Opening an environment with a Java file\r\n- Opening a contract from that environment\r\n- Running a proof in preconfigured auto-mode  (see note below)\r\n- Receiving notifications about the proof state\r\n\r\n**Additional improvements on Python side (see `main.py`):**\r\n- Pythonic interface with context managers that automatically dispose KeY/Environment/Proof\r\n- Registration of notification callbacks\r\n\r\n**What does not work yet:**\r\n- JSON annotation with classes: The fact that the Python API is behaving correctly here is more accidental\r\n  Right now the Java side only annotates top level objects, this needs to be fixed in the serializer, but I'm not certain how\r\n- Configuration of proof running\r\n- Testing/Stabilizing other endpoints\r\n\r\n**Concerning proofs in auto mode:**  \r\nThe proof control classes on the weigl/jsonrpc branch differed from the proof control classes on the main branch.\r\nAs the classes on weigl/jsonrpc were broken (even the example project didn't run), I have reset those classes to what the main branch does.  \r\nOn the weigl/jsonrpc branch there was some additional thread locking, but in my understanding this is not necessary:  \r\nWhen the auto mode command is invoked, the Thread of the future returned by ProofApi.auto waits for completion while the other thread runs the actual proof.","created_at":"2025-02-20T13:22:34Z","updated_at":"2025-02-20T19:24:40Z","closed_at":"2025-02-20T19:24:38Z","merged_at":"2025-02-20T19:24:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"e1c2b46dc46e431ab58b016abb577f89249de464","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/pulls/3567/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/pulls/3567/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/issues/3567/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/statuses/a70a80081c8030f2742cc830c009cb9376f1e5dd","head":{"label":"KeYProject:steuber/jsonrpc","ref":"steuber/jsonrpc","sha":"a70a80081c8030f2742cc830c009cb9376f1e5dd","user":{"login":"KeYProject","id":18749969,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE4NzQ5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18749969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject","html_url":"https://github.com/KeYProject","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":580489837,"node_id":"R_kgDOIpmSbQ","name":"key","full_name":"KeYProject/key","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KeYProject","id":18749969,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE4NzQ5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18749969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject","html_url":"https://github.com/KeYProject","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KeYProject/key","description":"KeY

for submitting this pull request for KeY.\r\nSince the project has a strict review policy, please make the\r\nreviewer's job easier by providing the necessary information\r\nin the text below. The comments can be deleted, but may also \r\nremain since they will be invisible when showing the PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\nThe current proof obligation (`DependencyContractPO`) only verifies that the return value of a method only depends on the locations in the accessible clause. In contrast, this new proof obligation additionally verifies that any objects on the heap (except those newly created) only depend on the locations in the accessible clause.\r\n\r\nThe formula that is generated by this proof obligation for a method `m` with contract $(\\mathit{pre}, \\mathit{post}, \\mathit{mod}, \\mathit{dep})$ is roughly\r\n\r\n$$\\mathit{pre} \\wedge \\mathit{freePre} \\wedge \\langle \\mathtt{res = m(args...)@C; } \\rangle (h_1 = \\mathtt{heap} \\wedge r_1 = \\mathtt{res}) \\wedge \\\\{u\\\\} \\langle \\mathtt{res = m(args...)@C; } \\rangle (h_2 = \\mathtt{heap} \\wedge r_2 = \\mathtt{res}) \\rightarrow \\mathit{mod} \\subseteq \\mathit{dep} \\wedge r_1 = r_2 \\wedge \\forall o; \\forall f; ((o,f) \\in \\mathit{mod} \\rightarrow o.f@h_1 = o.f@h_2) $$\r\n\r\nWhile testing, you may run into #3563, so beware.\r\n\r\nA simple example which proves succesfully with the current proof obligation, but cannot be proven with this new one is as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n/*@ public normal_behavior\r\n@ accessible x;\r\n@ assignable x;\r\n@ ensures \\result == x; \r\n@*/\r\npublic int foo() {\r\n  if (this.y > 0) {\r\n    this.x += 1;\r\n    return x - 1;\r\n  }\r\n  return this.x;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\n<!-- If this pull request is not yet finished, but has open jobs,\r\n     please list them here.

PR adds axioms for some (dynamically generated) taclets to the SMT translation. Most of these taclets are axioms for class invariants (static/non-static, free, ...).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the semantics of the bsum binder should be translated (not yet working).\r\n\r\n## Related Issue\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses (parts of) #3555.\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\nThe goal was to make SaddleBackSearch and SumAndMax provable with SMT prep. macro + Z3. At the moment, most of the branches close but two subgoals are left open (probably because of bsum).\r\n\r\n* [x] Translate generated axiom taclets (static/non-static/free/free static inv., partial inv., represents axioms)\r\n* [ ] Find a way to translate more complicated taclets (varcond, more complex schema variables...)\r\n* [ ] Translate bsum, bprod, etc.? We looked into it a bit, maybe we could use the technique described in \"Reasoning about comprehensions with first-order SMT solvers\" (Leino and Monahan, 2009, https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1529282.1529411).\r\n* [ ] Code cleanup\r\n* [ ] Document the changes\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n    \r\n- [ ] I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n- [ ] I made sure that new/changed end-user features are well documented (https://github.com/KeYProject/key-docs).\r\n- [ ] I added new test case(s) for new functionality.\r\n- [ ] I have tested the feature as follows: ...\r\n- [ ] I have checked that runtime performance has not deteriorated.\r\n\r\n## Additional information and contact(s)\r\n\r\nSome implementation details and considerations:\r\n* At the moment, assertions for all the (generated invariant, model method definition, and represents) taclets are added eagerly. If that turns out to inflate the problem too much and induce a significant performance decrease, we could in the future try to add them lazily. However, in my manual experiments it did not make a massive difference (was still nearly instant). \r\n* Note that there is a restriction that taclets with varconds can not be translated at all. Apparently, `\\notFreeIn` does not count as a varcond however. This is not a problem here, since all the term schema variables are bound variables after translation.\r\n* There was a restriction that the taclets to translates were only allowed to have SchemaVariables of type `TermSV` and `FormulaSV`. We relaxed that for `VariableSV` now (it worked out of the box with the same code after removing the check), since that is needed to translate taclets containing binders.\r\n* The taclets to be translated are selected by name prefixes. In `ModularSMTLib2Translator` there is a list of prefixes. However, it is probably incomplete at the moment. \r\n\r\nThis was done during the 3rd HacKeYthon.

Intended Change\r\n\r\nI wanted to quickly test something and realized that the current state of the example application makes it hard to use.\r\nThis is due to two reasons:\r\n- No gradle application configuration (meaning you can't use `run`)\r\n- No logging configuration (meaning the example application's `LOGGER.info` calls are not printed)\r\n\r\nThis pull request is supposed to fix this.\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? \r\n      Delete those lines that do not apply.      \r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Bug fix (non-breaking change

Related Issue\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses #1703.\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an option which allows disabling the type hierarchy in the SMT translation. With that option set, the translation is still sound, but possibly \"less complete\" than the original translation, but might find some proofs faster, since the embeddings necessary to encode the type hierarchy can mislead the solvers.\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \r\n> Note: At the moment, the feature is only partially implemented, which leads to many exceptions when trying to run an SMT solver.! \r\n\r\n* [ ] Fix and finish implementation\r\n* [ ] At the moment, a new solver is added (Z3 variant without type hierarchy translation). Maybe it is better to have a toggle that applies to all solvers.\r\n* [ ] Document the changes\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n- [ ] I made sure that new/changed end-user features are well documented (https://github.com/KeYProject/key-docs).\r\n- [ ] I added new test case(s) for new functionality.\r\n- [ ] I have tested the feature as follows: ...\r\n- [ ] I have checked that runtime performance has not deteriorated.\r\n\r\n## Additional information and contact(s)\r\n\r\nThis feature was mostly implemented during the 2nd HacKeYthon 2024.\r\nThanks to @BookWood7th, @roundEaredSengi and @vb213!\r\n     \r\n\r\nThe contributions within this pull request are licensed under GPLv2 (only) for inclusion in

Intended Change\r\n\r\nThis PR brings smaller local clean-ups: \r\n\r\n1. Removal of the package `key.api`. The proof script debugger development once drove this package but was always behind its potential. In future, it will be replaced by the REST API or use the classes directly.\r\n2. Removal of `ScriptLineParser` for test fixtures. Instead of this custom class, you should use yaml. Yaml is a full-grown language with editor support, comments, etc., and libraries. You can either program the loading by hand using `jackson`'s serialization API, or use `@YamlSource` from the JUnit library.\r\n3. Renovation of Gradle. The usage of `allprojects` and `subprojects` are discourage. The new way of managing multi-project Gradle projects is via `buildSrc` and writing central plugins. \r\n   1. Central management of dependencies (BOM) using `gradle/lib.versions.toml`. \r\n   2. Removal of ANTLR v2 + v3 from the dependencies.\r\n","created_at":"2025-02-08T16:41:18Z","updated_at":"2025-02-15T01:28:21Z","closed_at":"2025-02-15T01:28:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"befc017c3345038b63a62888783657c4df1881c5","assignee":{"login":"wadoon","id":104259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wadoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"wadoon","id":104259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wadoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/KeYProject/key/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/milestones/8/labels","id":11825963,"node_id":"MI_kwDOIpmSbc4AtHMr","number":8,"title":"v2.12.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"wadoon","id":104259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wadoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":13,"closed_issues":18,"state":"open","created_at":"2024-10-31T08:54:29Z","updated_at":"2025-06-22T23:46:22Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/pulls/3544/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/pulls/3544/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/issues/3544/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/statuses/6f91e2f7964b8d8af7fd74f983cda42fc821896e","head":{"label":"KeYProject:weigl/cleanups","ref":"weigl/cleanups","sha":"6f91e2f7964b8d8af7fd74f983cda42fc821896e","user":{"login":"KeYProject","id":18749969,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE4NzQ5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18749969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject","html_url":"https://github.com/KeYProject","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeYProject/received_events","type":"Organization","u

deactivated Sonarqube. We seem to have a deeper inner confusion with our common understanding of clean code. \r\n\r\nFirst, this PR reactivates the Checkstyle on changed files still within Gradle.\r\n\r\n1. Checkstyle is executed on all changed files in comparison to `origin/main`. This solution does not respect lines. \r\n2. Reporting works overall possible reliable ways: \r\n   1. Markdown Job summary is added\r\n[![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2011901c-c3e2-4069-a154-06058b13d79c)](https://github.com/KeYProject/key/actions/runs/12911732379?pr=3539#summary-3600483672)\r\n   2.

Variable `$buildDir` is deprecated and we should use `layout.buildDirectory`\r\n3. Jacoco is now integrated in the regular Gradle files (no conditional loading anymore), and the `enabled` switch is used for activation/deactiviation.\r\n4. At the end of the Github tests runs, a Python scripts runs through the JUnit test summaries and prints out [Github annotations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-an-error-message). \r\n6.

KeY parser\r\n* [x] Document the changes\r\n* [ ] (optional) Make sure the realtime colour update works with the Java version since that may be configured at runtime\r\n\r\nThe code is there can be reused from other places.\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally change). Actually improvements in the error editor windows.\r\n- New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n- There are minor improvements in the UI\r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n\r\n- I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n- I have tested the feature as follows: tried it out.\r\n\r\nThe

is a refined version of #3498. It removes the Eclipse formatter version lock (not needed any more, since the bug in the formatter has been fixed). In addition, it adds a small Java utility that can be used to merge two XML code style files.\r\n\r\nNew tool for merging Eclipse code style files: Every few versions, the Eclipse formatter comes with a few new options for configuration. It was a very annoying to find out which keys are missing in the style file `scripts/tools/checkstyle/keyCodeStyle.xml`, so this PR adds a small tool to merge two such files. It resides in the same directory as the style file.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to add the new options to our style file is to open the Eclipse GUI and export the style (in this example to `scripts/tools/checkstyle/eclipse.xml`). The styles could then be merged like this:\r\n```bash\r\ncd scripts/tools/checkstyle\r\ncp keyCodeStyle.xml keyCodeStyle_old.xml\r\n# optionally, the flag --overwriteValues can be used to replace all the old values with those set in eclipse.xml\r\njava CodeStyleMerger.java keyCodeStyle_old.xml eclipse.xml keyCodeStyle.xml\r\n```\r\nAfterwards, since the tool makes sure to sort the entries by the keys, it can be easily seen via `git diff keyCodeStyle.xml` what has changes. Optionally, you can now set the values of the new keys (by manually editing the file).\r\n\r\nIn contrast to #3498, the formatter is configured to not touch code blocks in comments.\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n* removes formatter version lock\r\n* adds tool for merging style files\r\n* slightly changes style (disable formatting of code blocks in comments/JavaDoc)\r\n* applies the new style\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- There are changes to the deployment/CI infrastructure (gradle, github, ...): Small change of the code style\r\n- Other: There is a new tool for developers\r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n    \r\n- I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n\r\nThe contributions within this pull request are licensed under GPLv2 (only) for inclusion in KeY.\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-05T16:55:29Z","updated_at":"2024-12-05T21:08:07Z","closed_at":"2024-12-05T21:08:06Z","merged_at":"2024-12-05T21:08:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"1b3f51f0c995a1b97560922f4af364d5ba4830ed","assignee":{"login":"WolframPfeifer","id":94171076,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZzvxA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94171076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer","html_url":"https://github.com/WolframPfeifer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"WolframPfeifer","id":94171076,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZzvxA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94171076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer","html_url":"https://github.com/WolframPfeifer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolframPfeifer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4940938970,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIpmSbc8AAAABJoC-2g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":"New feature or request"},{"id":4940939197,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIpmSbc8AAAABJoC_vQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/labels/Deployment","name":"Deployment","color":"C5DEF5","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4940992181,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIpmSbc8AAAABJoGOtQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/labels/Infrastructure","name":"Infrastructure","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Changes to the Github configurations, repository or other non-source stuff"},{"id":4940995779,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIpmSbc8AAAABJoGcww","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/labels/%F0%9F%9B%A0%20Maintenance","name":"🛠 Maintenance","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":"Code quality and related things w/o functional changes"},{"id":6011812077,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIpmSbc8AAAABZlT47Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/labels/Ignore%20in%20Changelog","name":"Ignore in Changelog","color":"D4C5F9","default":false,"description":"If given, a PR will not be considered for Changelog generation.

to 4\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/actions/releases\">gradle/actions's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v4.0.0</h2>\n<p>Final release of <code>v4.0.0</code> of the <code>setup-gradle</code>, <code>dependency-submission</code> and <code>wrapper-validation</code> actions provided under <code>gradle/actions</code>.\nThis release is available under the <code>v4</code> tag.</p>\n<h2>Major changes from the <code>v3</code> release</h2>\n<h3>The <code>arguments</code> parameter has been removed</h3>\n<p>Using the action to execute Gradle via the <code>arguments </code>parameter was deprecated in <code>v3</code> and this parameter has been removed.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/actions/blob/v4.0.0-rc.1/docs/deprecation-upgrade-guide.md#using-the-action-to-execute-gradle-via-the-arguments-parameter-is-deprecated\">See here for more details</a>.</p>\n<h3>Cache cleanup enabled by default</h3>\n<p>After a number of fixes and improvements, this release enables <a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/actions/blob/v4.0.0-rc.1/docs/setup-gradle.md#configuring-cache-cleanup\">cache-cleanup</a> by default for all Jobs using the <code>setup-gradle</code> and <code>dependency-submission</code> actions.</p>\n<p>Improvements and bugfixes related cache cleanup:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By default, cache cleanup is not run if any Gradle build fails (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/71\">#71</a>)</li>\n<li>Cache cleanup is not run after configuration-cache reuse (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/19\">#19</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This feature should help to minimize the size of entries written to the GitHub Actions cache, speeding up builds and reducing cache usage.</p>\n<h3>Wrapper validation enabled by default</h3>\n<p>In <code>v3</code>, the <code>setup-gradle</code> action was enhanced to support Gradle wrapper validation, removing the need to use a separate workflow\nfile with the <code>gradle/actions/wrapper-validation</code> action.</p>\n<p>With this release, wrapper validation has been significantly improved, and is now enabled by default (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/12\">#12</a>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>allow-snapshot-wrappers</code> makes it possible to validate snapshot wrapper jars using <code>setup-gradle</code>.</li>\n<li>Checksums for <a href=\"https://services.gradle.org/distributions-snapshots/\">nightly and snapshot Gradle versions</a> are now validated (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/281\">#281</a>).</li>\n<li>Valid wrapper checksums are cached in Gradle User Home, reducing the need to retrieve checksum values remotely (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/172\">#172</a>).</li>\n<li>Reduce network calls in <code>wrapper-validation</code> for new Gradle versions: By only fetching wrapper checksums for Gradle versions that were not known when this action was released, this release reduces the likelihood that a network failure could cause failure in wrapper validation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/171\">#171</a>)</li>\n<li>Improved error message when <code>wrapper-validation</code> finds no wrapper jars (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/284\">#284</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wrapper validation is important for supply-chain integrity. Enabling this feature by default will increase the coverage of wrapper\nvalidation on projects using GitHub Actions.</p>\n<h3>New input parameters for Dependency Graph generation</h3>\n<p>Some dependency-graph inputs that could previously only be configured via environment variables now have dedicated action inputs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>dependency-graph-report-dir</code>: sets the location where dependency-graph reports will be generated</li>\n<li><code>dependency-graph-exclude-projects</code> and <code>dependency-graph-include-projects</code>: <a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/actions/blob/v4.0.0-rc.1/docs/dependency-submission.md#selecting-gradle-projects-that-will-contribute-to-the-dependency-graph\">select which Gradle projects will contribute to the generated dependency graph</a>.</li>\n<li><code>dependency-graph-exclude-configurations</code> and <code>dependency-graph-include-configurations</code>: <a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/actions/blob/v4.0.0-rc.1/docs/dependency-submission.md#selecting-gradle-configurations-that-will-contribute-to-the-dependency-graph\">select which Gradle configurations will contribute to the generated dependency graph</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In Job summary, the action now provides an explanation when cache is set to <code>read-only</code> or <code>disabled</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/255\">#255</a>)</li>\n<li>When <code>setup-gradle</code> requests a specific Gradle version, the action will no longer download and install that version if it is already available on the <code>PATH</code> of the runner (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/270\">#270</a>)</li>\n<li>To attempt to speed up builds, the <code>setup-gradle</code> and <code>dependency-submission</code> actions now attempt to use the <code>D:</code> drive for Gradle User Home  if it is available (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/290\">#290</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Deprecations and breaking changes</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Refactoring \r\n\r\nThis PR starts the removal of generic data classes in favor of Java records (aka. named tuples). In this PR, only `Triple` and `Quadruple` are removed. \r\n\r\nIn general, generic parametric data classes (`Tuple`, `Union`, ...) lead to unreadable, incomprehensible code, e.g., what does the entity `Triple<StatementBlock, URI, Integer>` express? Answer: It is the key in a map to find block contracts. Using the record `BlockContractKey` expresses this better than triple of something. \r\n\r\nTherefore, records give you the chance of defining useful variable names, and documentation,  and also avoid auto-boxing (hence NPE). \r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\nNo use of `Triple<…>` and `Quadruple<…>`.\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- **X** Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally change)\r\n- **X** There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n    \r\n- **X** by TEST CASES!!! and

the KaKeY meeting (2024-10-25), we discussed a change of the version scheme. To be more precise, we want to drop the old Linux kernel/odd-even version numbering. \r\n\r\n*Currently,* the development version of KeY is 2.13.0. The release created from this development will be `2.14.0`. After this release, the development version will become `2.15.0`. Odd numbers for development, even numbers for releases.\r\n\r\n**New,** we keep in line with our release versioning. The current released version is `2.12.3`, so our development version would be `2.12.4-dev`. If the version steps through the releasing stages, it becomes `2.12.4-alpha`, `2.12.4-beta`, and `2.12.4-rc`. Finally, it will result in the release `2.12.4`. If the release is larger, it can also be lifted from PATCH to MINOR and become the release `2.13.0`.\r\n\r\nThis versioning scheme conforms to SemVer, particularly [§9](https://semver.org/#spec-item-9).\r\n\r\nThis pull request changes the versioning of artifacts accordingly in the `build.gradle`.\r\n\r\nPlease comment @mattulbrich,

description of what behaviour changes and \r\n     why it should be changed. -->\r\n\r\nCurrently goals are only closed if the associated taclet is a closing taclet or alternatively if the rule application is a SMTRuleApp.\r\nTo enable other external solvers to close goals, this pull request adds a layer of abstraction that is used instead of SMTRuleApp to determine if the goal was closed.\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? \r\n      Delete those lines that do not apply.      \r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally change)\r\n- There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n\r\n<!--- How did you make sure that the proposed change improves the code base? \r\n      Delete those lines that do not apply.\r\n      Please make an effort to delete as few lines as possible. :-)\r\n-->\r\n    \r\n- I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n- I have tested the feature as follows: KeY test suite\r\n- I have checked that runtime performance has not deteriorated.\r\n\r\n## Additional information

The comments can be deleted, but may also \r\nremain since they will be invisible when showing the PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\nAdds a plugin, which allows the user to automatically translate a KeY sequent to an Isabelle theory and run parts of the automation of Isabelle on the translation. As presented at the KeY Symposium 2024\r\n\r\nThis broadens the automated toolset of KeY users, which allows for more automated proofs.\r\n<!-- Please give a brief description of what behaviour changes and \r\n     why it should be changed. -->\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? \r\n      Delete those lines that do not apply.      \r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally change)\r\n- New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n\r\n<!--- How did you make sure that the proposed change improves the code base? \r\n      Delete those lines that do not apply.\r\n      Please make an effort to delete as few

<a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/actions/compare/v4.0.0...v4.0.1\">https://github.com/gradle/actions/compare/v4.0.0...v4.0.1</a></p>\n<h2>v4.0.0</h2>\n<p>Final release of <code>v4.0.0</code> of the <code>setup-gradle</code>, <code>dependency-submission</code> and <code>wrapper-validation</code> actions provided under <code>gradle/actions</code>.\nThis release is available under the <code>v4</code> tag.</p>\n<h2>Major changes from the <code>v3</code> release</h2>\n<h3>The <code>arguments</code> parameter has been removed</h3>\n<p>Using the action to execute Gradle via the <code>arguments </code>parameter was deprecated in <code>v3</code> and this parameter has been removed.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/actions/blob/v4.0.0-rc.1/docs/deprecation-upgrade-guide.md#using-the-action-to-execute-gradle-via-the-arguments-parameter-is-deprecated\">See here for more details</a>.</p>\n<h3>Cache cleanup enabled by default</h3>\n<p>After a number of fixes and improvements, this release enables <a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/actions/blob/v4.0.0-rc.1/docs/setup-gradle.md#configuring-cache-cleanup\">cache-cleanup</a> by default for all Jobs using the <code>setup-gradle</code> and <code>dependency-submission</code> actions.</p>\n<p>Improvements and bugfixes related cache cleanup:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By default, cache cleanup is not run if any Gradle build fails (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/71\">#71</a>)</li>\n<li>Cache cleanup is not run after configuration-cache reuse (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/19\">#19</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This feature should help to minimize the size of entries written to the GitHub Actions cache, speeding up builds and reducing cache usage.</p>\n<h3>Wrapper validation enabled by default</h3>\n<p>In <code>v3</code>, the <code>setup-gradle</code> action was enhanced to support Gradle wrapper validation, removing the need to use a separate workflow\nfile with the <code>gradle/actions/wrapper-validation</code> action.</p>\n<p>With this release, wrapper validation has been significantly improved, and is now enabled by default (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/12\">#12</a>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>allow-snapshot-wrappers</code> makes it possible to validate snapshot wrapper jars using <code>setup-gradle</code>.</li>\n<li>Checksums for <a href=\"https://services.gradle.org/distributions-snapshots/\">nightly and snapshot Gradle versions</a> are now validated (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/281\">#281</a>).</li>\n<li>Valid wrapper checksums are cached in Gradle User Home, reducing the need to retrieve checksum values remotely (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/172\">#172</a>).</li>\n<li>Reduce network calls in <code>wrapper-validation</code> for new Gradle versions: By only fetching wrapper checksums for Gradle versions that were not known when this action was released, this release reduces the likelihood that a network failure could cause failure in wrapper validation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/171\">#171</a>)</li>\n<li>Improved error message when <code>wrapper-validation</code> finds no wrapper jars (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/284\">#284</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wrapper validation is important for supply-chain integrity. Enabling this feature by default will increase the coverage of wrapper\nvalidation on projects using GitHub Actions.</p>\n<h3>New input parameters for Dependency Graph generation</h3>\n<p>Some dependency-graph inputs that could previously only be configured via environment variables now have dedicated action inputs:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

to solve #3500, this PR does two things:\r\n* It adds an option to disable the ProofTree tooltips, as requested for example by @unp1 and @mattulbrich. This option can be set in the options of the proof tree (gear icon) as well as in the global menu via \"View\" -> \"Show ProofTree Tooltips\" (where the SequentView and SourceView tooltips also can be toggled).\r\n* A tooltip is now lazily rendered directly when it is needed, not already during creation of the GUITreeNode.\r\n\r\n## Related Issue\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses #3500.\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n- There are changes to the taclet rule base\r\n- There are changes to the deployment/CI infrastructure (gradle, github, ...)\r\n- Other: \r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n   \r\n- [x] I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n- I made sure that new/changed end-user features are well documented (https://github.com/KeYProject/key-docs).\r\n- I added new test case(s) for new functionality.\r\n- [x] I have tested the feature as follows: manual inspection and testing in the GUI\r\n- [x] I have checked that runtime performance has not deteriorated.\r\n\r\n## Additional

PR fixes a visual bug in the Options dialog when changing the colors.\r\nThe bug was originally discovered by @BookWood7th (on Windows, but I think that is irrelevant), who also provided this screenshot that shows the problem:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-08-23 142549](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a9d9653-f178-4201-a9f3-d3750dfdb804)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n* Fix of the visual bug where during editing of a color text field, the text gets unreadable and weirdly overlaps. The fix was to set the field to transparent. I do not know why it works, but somehow opaque components do not work correctly with background colors that also contain alpha.\r\n* Fix: For the preview icons besides the color (in non-edited cells), the alpha channel was not correctly interpreted: It seems that it was interpreted as if the background was black. When merged with the non-alpha part, it resulted in colors that are usually not shown in the GUI (since the background color is not black there). Now, background is interpreted as white, which is much better in my opinion (compare for instance the first two colors between the screenshots: they represent the same color code!).\r\n\r\nNew screenshot with the fix:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75c524c2-6079-418a-8be6-487be87ca23a)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which

Description\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses #3501. Since this a warning (or better, lots of them) that potentially confuses the users, this very minor PR decreases the log level from INFO to DEBUG.\r\n\r\nThese duplicate sort declarations in the taclet base have been there for quite a long time and do not break anything. The purpose of the warning is to indicate that we should finally get rid of the duplicate declarations. However, at the moment this is difficult due to the lack of local namespaces for generic sorts.\r\n\r\nSee also the discussion here: #3302\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contributions within this pull request are
