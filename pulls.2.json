Intended Change\r\n\r\nFinal fields cannot change their value after a single assignment in the constructor. In the current KeY logic, final fields are treated like normal fields stored on the heap. This is highly inefficient since heap assignments cannot have an impact on final fields at all.\r\n\r\nThe plan is hence to access final fields using a function of their own that does not depend on the heap, unlike other fields\r\n\r\n    T::select(Heap, Object, Field)   // for non-final fields\r\n    T::final(Object, Field)  // for final fields\r\n\r\nThe major challenges include\r\n- adapting reading of final fields in modalities\r\n- adapting accessing final fields in JML\r\n- handling constructors: they are allowed to write.\r\n\r\nWriting must somehow be restricted since any modality could write to final fields and thus compromise proofs if thus different inconsistent values for final fields are around on a sequent.\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\n* [x] Add functions for finals, add a taclet option\r\n* [x] Implement rules that act upon those taclet options\r\n* [x] Implement special treatment for constructors\r\n* [x] Test effectiveness\r\n* [x] Code cleanup\r\n* [x] Document the changes\r\n\r\nThe following new items showed up:\r\n* [x] Deal with prettyprinting of final fields using select. Currently o.f is the prettyprinting for both accesses.\r\n* [x] Deal with parsing of final fields in JavaDL. o.f means something different now ...\r\n* [x] `static final` fields are a challenge since they need double special treatment in parsing and prettyprinting\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- Breaking change (feature that cause existing functionality to change)\r\n\r\nThe plan is to have a taclet otion to fall back to old behaviour.\r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n\r\nTo do:\r\n \r\n- [x] I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n- [x] I made sure that new/changed end-user features are well documented (https://github.com/KeYProject/key-docs).\r\n- [x] I added new test case(s) for new functionality.\r\n- [x] I have checked that runtime performance has not deteriorated.\r\n\r\n## Additional information and contact(s)\r\n\r\nIt is the modernised version of #3189.\r\n\r\n@WolframPfeifer @wadoon \r\n\r\nThe

fixes a bug introduced in v3.4.0, that prevents build scan publication to Develocity.\nThe bug results in the removal of the <code>DEVELOCITY_ACCESS_KEY</code> variable being removed, so that Gradle cannot authenticate with the Develocity server.</p>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't clear access key when access token cannot be obtained by <a

href=\"https://github.com/gradle/actions/compare/v3.4.0...v3.4.1\">https://github.com/gradle/actions/compare/v3.4.0...v3.4.1</a></p>\n<h2>v3.4.0</h2>\n<p>This release improves the integration with Gradle Develocity®, as well as updating a number of key dependencies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The new <code>develocity-access-key</code> input parameter allows the action to generate a short-lived access token for subsequent\ncommunication with Develocity. This reduces the risk of the full (long-lived) access key being compromised,\neither accidentally or by a malicious action.</li>\n<li>New input parameters are available to configure Develocity injection. Previously Develocity injection could only be\nenabled by setting environment variables.</li>\n<li>Checksums for Gradle 8.8 are now included, so that no network request is required for <code>wrapper-validation</code> with Gradle 8.8 wrappers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add support for short-lived tokens by <a

Related Issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Please remove if this PR is not related to an issue. -->\r\n<!-- Please add number if it is in answer to an issue. -->\r\nThis pull request addresses #.\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief description of what behaviour changes and \r\n     why it should be changed. -->\r\n\r\nThis adds functionality to check a single control-flow trace in KeY,\r\nso only one path in the symbolic execution path.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to record the control flow while running normally.\r\nAnd then we use the recorded path as a precondition for any\r\nproof obligation.\r\n\r\nFor experimenting and debugging method contracts and similar,\r\nthis might be very useful:\r\n\r\n* We do not need any auxiliary specification (loop invariants, called method contracts, proof scripts).\r\n* For a method contract KeY could not verify, it might be useful to explore just a single path (debugging of method contracts).\r\n\r\n## Backgound\r\n\r\nI already had a previous approach using JML assume, see\r\nhttps://github.com/lks9/retroACexampleKeY/\r\n\r\nThe current implementation uses new taclet rules traceIf, traceElse (and the ones without else-branch).\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\n<!-- If this pull request is not yet finished, but has open jobs,\r\n     please list them here. It helps others to estimate the state of this\r\n     PR.

time.\r\n     The following items are examples:\r\n-->\r\n* [ ] Automatic Instrumentation for recording (outside KeY)\r\n* [ ] Trace conversion for use in KeY (outside KeY)\r\n* [ ] Tracing rules for

recently merged PR #3353 only partially fixes the overflow checking: All the taclets in `integerAssignment2UpdateRules.key`, which add another formula to the sequent for the overflow check, are missing the `\\sameUpdateLevel` constraint. This can lead to unprovable overflow check branches (see the `inInt` line in the screenshot below, which talks about the variables `_a` and `_b` instead of `a` and `b`).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/KeYProject/key/assets/94171076/0868a94c-465b-42ff-9163-febc5e2acfc8)\r\n\r\nBtw.: I think that the bug is \"only\" a completeness issue and not soundness critical, since the variables can only appear in the inInt(...) predicate and the original modality and nowhere else on the sequent.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fix in the rules, this PR adds test cases (one provable and one unprovable) for each of the test cases, which hopefully will help in the future to detect such problems earlier.\r\n\r\n## Related Issue\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes the only

The comments can be deleted, but may also \r\nremain since they will be invisible when showing the PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Related Issue\r\n\r\nThis pull request depends on PR #3459, which should be merged before reviewing this PR.\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief description of what behaviour changes and \r\n     why it should be changed. -->\r\nThis PR adds the new collection ``LinkedHashMapWrapper`` that can be used like the ``LinkedHashMap`` in key.core/de.uka.ilkd.key.util. The difference is, that elements are wrapped internally so that ``equalsModProperty()`` and ``hashCodeModProperty()`` are used instead of the normal ``equals()`` and ``hashCode()`` methods.\r\n\r\nFor this to work, ``hashCodeModProperty()`` is implemented for all properties introduced in #3459.\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n~~Use general navigation structure instead of TreeWalker for hashCodeModThisProperty~~\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? \r\n      Delete those lines that do not apply.      \r\n-->\r\n\r\n- New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n\r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n\r\n<!--- How did you make sure that the proposed change improves the code base? \r\n      Delete those lines that do not apply.\r\n      Please make an effort to delete as few lines as possible. :-)\r\n-->\r\n    \r\n- I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n- I added new test case(s) for new functionality.\r\n- I have tested the feature as follows: Already existing and new tests\r\n\r\n<!-- ## Additional

-->\r\n<!-- Please add number if it is in answer to an issue. -->\r\nThis pull request addresses #3407.\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\nKeY now supports the type `\\TYPE`, the subtype operator `<:`, and the function `\\type`.\r\n\r\nThe following method contract illustrates their semantics:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass A {\r\n\r\n    int f;\r\n\r\n    //@ ghost \\TYPE packed;\r\n    //@ invariant packed <: \\type(A) ==> f > 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass B extends A {\r\n    //@ invariant packed <: \\type(B) ==> f > 1;\r\n\r\n    //@ requires this.packed == \\type(B);\r\n    //@ ensures f > 0;\r\n    //@ ensures f > 1;\r\n    void subtypes() {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? \r\n      Delete those lines that do not apply.      \r\n-->\r\n\r\n- New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n- There are changes to the taclet rule base\r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n

for submitting this pull request for KeY.\r\nSince the project has a strict review policy, please make the\r\nreviewer's job easier by providing the necessary information\r\nin the text below. The comments can be deleted, but may also \r\nremain since they will be invisible when showing the PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief description of what behaviour changes and \r\n     why it should be changed. -->\r\nBuilding on top of #3386, the interface `EqualsModProperty` has now been changed so that it can be used not just with `Term`s but theoretically any class if a proper `Property` is implemented. The signature of the method has also been slightly modified so that it is able to handle equality checks that utilize additional parameters (like was the case with `equalsModRenaming` defined on `SourceElement`s that is also refactored with this PR).\r\n~~To refactor `equalsModRenaming` of `SourceElement`, a new Interface `TreeWalker` and implementing class `JavaASTTreeWalker` have been introduced that make it possible to move through the tree of  SourceElements step by step.~~\r\nThe new general navigation structure is used to move through the tree of SourceElements.\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\n<!-- If this pull request is not yet finished, but has open jobs,\r\n     please list them here. It helps others to estimate the state of this\r\n     PR.

The special cases that did not call `equalsModRenaming` in `equals` or made use of the `NameAbstractionTable` are now handled by a `JavaASTTreeWalker`.\r\n     \r\n<!-- DRAFT MODE: Please note that on

pull request adds module support in KeY by adding `module-info.java` and doing the necessary stuff. Modules for `key.util` and `key.ncore` have already been added by @Drodt on `main`. This is dangerous situation where some jars are modules, some are not. \r\n\r\nThere are two main issues with modules in KeY: \r\n\r\n- clashing Java packages (packages are sealed)\r\n- Docking Frames is not-modularized \r\n\r\nThis PR does not change the package names, when not necessary. \r\n\r\n**Benefits:** Along with adding the Java modules, various errors appeared and got repaired.\r\nFor examples, the slicing extension was added in the `META-INF` in KeY\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\n* In general this PR is ready!\r\n* **Except for one thing:** We have a problem with ST4 library added by `keyext.proofmanagement`, due to the lack of  module in ST4. There is a very old issue on [antlr/stringtemplate4](https://github.com/antlr/stringtemplate4/issues/216) open. \r\n  There are two solutions: \r\n    1. externalize proof management\r\n    2. Add a Gradle dependencies transformer thingy\r\n   \r\n* This PR also removes the JUnit 4 libraries and support of all key submodules. \r\n  This is one origin of errors when test cases can not be found. (There was only one JUnit test class left). JUnit 4 is still present in module `recoder`.\r\n* There was a new version of docking frames needed, which I have build and added as a SNAPSHOT. This version will be publish to  maven central when this PR is accepted. \r\n* `sun.misc.Signal`: The signal handling for SIGTERM is dropped. On some (linux) computer, this does not work properly all times (you can not abort KeY anymore). On Windows, gradle prompts a compile error. In the end, `Signal` class is part of the `jdk.unsupported` module. At this point you should recognise that is more luck that it works. \r\n* **Note:** Spotless format is terrible broken on `module-info.java`. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Plan\r\n\r\n* [x] Modularized Docking Frames (wip)\r\n* [x] `key.ext` libraries\r\n* [x] Code cleanup\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally

Intended Change\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the \"Copy referenced proof steps here\" action to allow applying it on any node that has leaf children with caching info.\r\nIt will then copy the referenced proof steps for all cached branches.\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the taclet rule base\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the deployment/CI infrastructure (gradle, github, ...)\r\n- [ ] Other: \r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n    \r\n- [ ] I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n- [ ] I made sure that new/changed end-user features are well documented

I.e., changing types where necessary, changing how modality schema vars are matched, and some changes to the term builder.\r\n\r\nAlso fixes the Github workflow.\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

The comments may remain since they will be\r\ninvisible when showing the PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\nThe specified path to a smt solver has been assembled incorrectly from the user input but still got cached in the proofIndependentSettings.props file. This caused a crash when restarting KeY. \r\nNow, \r\n1. the path is assembled correctly and\r\n2. an invalid smt solver path in proofIndependentSettings.props will be ignored, thereby avoiding a crash on program start.\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

for submitting this pull request for KeY.\r\nSince the project has a strict review policy, please make the\r\nreviewer's job easier by providing the necessary information\r\nin the text below. The comments may remain since they will be\r\ninvisible when showing the PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Related Issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Please remove if this PR is not related to an issue. -->\r\n<!-- Please add number if it is in answer to an issue. -->\r\nThis pull request addresses #3414.\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief description of what behaviour changes and \r\n     why it should be changed. -->\r\n\r\nRemove the old dialog to change taclet options. Taclet options can now be accessed through the new unified settings dialog (\"Options\" -> \"Show Settings\" -> \"Taclet Options\").\r\nAdditionally, a bug was fixed where a warning header did not disappear, even after a proof was loaded.\r\n\r\nAs of now, the radio buttons selected are still only the default ones and not the options selected in the current proof.\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in the box(es) that apply: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change) *Old Taclet Options are not accessible through the options tab directly anymore*\r\n- [x] There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the taclet rule base\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the deployment/CI infrastructure (gradle, github, ...)\r\n- [ ] Other: \r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n    \r\n- [x] I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments). *Really only inline comments*\r\n- [ ] I made sure that new/changed end-user features are well documented (https://github.com/KeYProject/key-docs).\r\n- [ ] I added new test case(s) for new functionality.\r\n- [x] I have tested the feature as follows: *I manually inspected the menus and how they behaved before and after loading a proof*\r\n- [ ] I have checked that runtime performance has not deteriorated.\r\n\r\n## Additional information and contact(s)\r\n\r\nAs a reference, how things were looking before and now:\r\n\r\nThe options tab previously had an entry to get to taclet options directly.\r\n![old_options](https://github.com/KeYProject/key/assets/93993502/f92d9d83-0357-4a38-aa32-c906add20d84)\r\n\r\nNow, this is not the case anymore since the options are now contained in a unified settings dialog.\r\n![new_options](https://github.com/KeYProject/key/assets/93993502/a75e9561-3d0e-4394-b7da-fcae1f69ef69)\r\n\r\nBefore, even when a proof was loaded, there was still a header shown in the taclet options stating that there was no proof loaded.\r\n![no_proof_header_still_visible](https://github.com/KeYProject/key/assets/93993502/ed96adbe-54d2-4d85-995d-80d2fbfc2bfd)\r\n\r\nThis is fixed now.\r\n![no_proof_header_invisible](https://github.com/KeYProject/key/assets/93993502/eaf9ba6e-0f35-410c-abe0-c79265393d8b)\r\n\r\nAt \"Proof\"->\"Show Active Taclet Options\" you can see the active taclet options with a path given at the bottom to change the taclet options. \r\n![active_taclet_settings_old](https://github.com/KeYProject/key/assets/93993502/5b2011a8-3c18-4701-8fc9-84be6f20fc2c)\r\n\r\nNow, the path to the taclet options has been changed to reflect the new way to change taclet options.\r\n![active_taclet_settings_new](https://github.com/KeYProject/key/assets/93993502/e4508eda-1c83-4ea1-9a92-d1643d9deb1f)\r\n\r\n<!-- Add further information to help the

Related Issue\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses #1663\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\nWhen using a library method without an explicit contract, instead of getting stuck in the proof, KeY now assumes the following default contract\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic behavior\r\n    ensures true;\r\n    diverges true;\r\n    signals_only Throwable;\r\n    assignable \\everything;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is a proof setting `soundDefaultContracts` which can be turned off. In this case, the following default contract is used instead, which may be useful for exploratory proofs\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic normal_behavior\r\n    ensures true;\r\n    assignable \\strictly_nothing;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Previously, there was one where the value of the clause (here `div`) is not true and the method therefore terminates, and one where the method does not terminate.\r\n\r\nE.g., the two POs would look like `pre & !div -> <m()>post` and `pre -> [m()] post`. This resulted in more complex proofs, because the case where `div` is false had to be considered as well for the second PO.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the POs to\r\n1. `pre & !div -> <m()>post` and\r\n2. `pre & div -> [m()] post`\r\n\r\nHence, we have a proper cut.\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

The comments may remain since they will be\r\ninvisible when showing the PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief description of what behaviour changes and \r\n     why it should be changed. -->\r\n\r\nBased on #3420. Changes the JML pareser to accept definitions of ADTs. Datatypes have a list of _constructors_ separated by `|`, and a body of functions.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Test {\r\n\t/*@ datatype List {\r\n\t  @ \tNil()\r\n\t  @\t| Cons(\\any head, List tail);\r\n\t  @\r\n\t  @ \tint size() {\r\n\t  @\t\treturn 0;\r\n\t  @ \t}\r\n\t  @ }\r\n\t  @*/\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, ADTs can only be defined on class-level, not inside methods or outside of classes.\r\n\r\nThere also is no semantics for these ADTs. KeY simply ignores them. Ideally, we want to use the defined types and functions in specification and translate them to KeY ADTs.\r\n\r\nWe also want to use the new Java switch expressions to allow pattern matching on ADTs, i.e,:\r\n```java\r\nswitch (list) {\r\n  case Nil -> 0;\r\n  case Cons(_, xs) -> 1 + xs.size();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpen questions are:\r\n- How are JML ADTs translated to KeY?\r\n- How are switch expressions with pattern matching translated?\r\n- Can we define a shorthand infix notation for ADT function, e.g., `l1 + l2` for `l1.append(l2)`?\r\n- How do we resolve ADT function calls in specification?\r\n- What happens if we already have a `List` class/interface?\r\n\r\nOpenJML has a similar concept of ADTs and pattern matching. For demonstration, [there is a list example](https://github.com/OpenJML/OpenJML/blob/master-21/OpenJMLTest/test/datatype/Test.java).\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

The comments may remain since they will be\r\ninvisible when showing the PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\nAdded a checkbox to the example loader dialog that allows to hide it on subsequent startups. I consider this a reasonable change as this functionality is already supported by KeY but hidden in the preferences which most user might never open. Additionally i think this is standard behavior for similar IDEs or programs. No default behavior is changed.\r\n<!-- Please give a brief description of what behaviour changes and \r\n     why it should be changed. -->\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Let's say you have a file like\r\n```\r\n\\datatypes {\r\n  List = Nil | Cons(any head, List tail)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nPreviously, a sort `List` and two functions `List Nil` and `List Cons(any, List)` were generated. Now, we also define two additional functions: `any head(List)` and `List tail(List)`, with the additional rules `head(Cons(h, t)) = h` and `tail(Cons(h, t)) = t`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we now raise exceptions, when ADT definitions overwrite functions defined elsewhere. If two deconstructors should be defined, an exception is also raised. But, two deconstructors with the same name and return type are permitted.\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the taclet rule base\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the deployment/CI infrastructure (gradle, github, ...)\r\n- [ ] Other: \r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n    \r\n- [x] I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n- [ ] I made sure that new/changed end-user features are well documented (https://github.com/KeYProject/key-docs).\r\n- [x] I added new test case(s) for new functionality.\r\n- [x] I have tested the feature as follows: 5/2 -5/2 5/-2 -5/-2 and checking that mod is nonnegative and x mod y < |y|\r\n- [ ] I have checked that runtime performance has not deteriorated.\r\n\r\n## Additional information and contact(s)\r\n\r\n<!-- Add further information to help the

PR does some cleanup in the .key LDT files:\r\n* The declaration of taclet options is moved from `ruleSetsDeclarations.key` into a separate file `optionsDeclarations.key`.\r\n* sort and function declarations are moved from `ruleSetsDeclarations.key` and `javaRules.key` into the new file `javaHeader.key`.\r\n* The loading order is changed slightly: First load the taclet options, then the rule sets, and then all the theories.\r\n* Provide a better error message when a sort declaration is ignored due to an earlier declaration.\r\n* A old dangling comment of a legacy taclet option which does not exist anymore (`optimisedSelectRules`) was removed.\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n- [x] There are changes to the taclet rule base (functionality should not change though)\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the deployment/CI infrastructure (gradle, github, ...)\r\n- [ ] Other: \r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n    \r\n- [ ] I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n- [ ] I made sure that new/changed end-user features are well documented (https://github.com/KeYProject/key-docs).\r\n- [ ] I added new test case(s) for new functionality.\r\n- [ ] I have tested the feature as follows: ...\r\n- [ ] I have checked that runtime performance

Refactoring \r\n\r\nThis PR starts the removal of generic data classes in favor of Java records (aka. named tuples). In this PR, only `Triple` and `Quadruple` are removed. \r\n\r\nIn general, generic parametric data classes (`Tuple`, `Union`, ...) lead to unreadable, incomprehensible code, e.g., what does the entity `Triple<StatementBlock, URI, Integer>` express? Answer: It is the key in a map to find block contracts. Using the record `BlockContractKey` expresses this better than triple of something. \r\n\r\nTherefore, records give you the chance of defining useful variable names, and documentation,  and also avoid auto-boxing (hence NPE). \r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\nNo use of `Triple<…>` and `Quadruple<…>`.\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- **X** Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally change)\r\n- **X** There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n    \r\n- **X** by TEST CASES!!! and

Intended Change\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a slicing failure with a specific proof. In that particular case, the dynamically added taclet was slightly too different for the previous code to pick it up.\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the taclet rule base\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the deployment/CI infrastructure (gradle, github, ...)\r\n- [ ] Other: \r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n    \r\n- [ ] I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n- [ ] I made sure that new/changed end-user features are well documented (https://github.com/KeYProject/key-docs).\r\n- [ ] I added new test case(s) for new functionality.\r\n- [x] I have tested the feature as follows: slicing now works for the (confidential) proof file\r\n- [ ] I have checked that runtime performance has not deteriorated.\r\n\r\n## Additional information and contact(s)\r\n\r\ncc

Intended Change\r\n\r\nThis changes the display of extension-provided context menu actions. If they set a menu path, it will now be respected when constructing the popup menu.\r\n\r\nThe second commit fixes a bug where it was no longer possible to disable extensions (they would always re-enable on next KeY launch).\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the taclet rule base\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the deployment/CI infrastructure (gradle, github, ...)\r\n- [ ] Other: \r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n    \r\n- [ ] I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n- [ ] I made sure that new/changed end-user features are well documented (https://github.com/KeYProject/key-docs).\r\n- [ ] I added new test case(s) for new functionality.\r\n- [x] I have tested the feature as follows: it works as expected for a new context menu action I added in another PR\r\n- [x] I have checked that runtime performance has not deteriorated.\r\n\r\n## Additional information and contact(s)\r\n\r\n<!-- Add further information to help the reviewer

for submitting this pull request for KeY.\r\nSince the project has a strict review policy, please make the\r\nreviewer's job easier by providing the necessary information\r\nin the text below. The comments may remain since they will be\r\ninvisible when showing the PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief description of what behaviour changes and \r\n     why it should be changed. -->\r\nThere were four different functions concerned with equality of terms other than the usual `equals`, namely `equalsModRenaming`, `equalsModTermLabels`, `equalsModIrrelevantTermLabels` and `equalsModProofIrrelevancy`. Now, there is a new Interface `EqualsModProperty`, which is extended by `Term`, with a single method `equalsModProperty` that takes two parameters: the object to be compared and one of the new type `TermProperty`, that implements the desired behavior of what to be ignored during the equality check.\r\nThe changes can be found in a new package called **equality** in the logic package of key.core. The `TermProperty`s are designed as a singleton and can be accessed through their respective static constants, e.g. `IRRELEVANT_TERM_LABELS_PROPERTY` in `IrrelevantTermLabelsProperty`.\r\n`Term` now no longer implements the Interface `EqualsModProofIrrelevancy`. Therefore it might be a problem if you wanted to use terms in an `EquivalenceDirectedGraph`. \r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in the box(es) that apply: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally change) _Behavior of equalsMod... methods combined into a singular method called equalsModProperty_\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change) _Term no longer implements EqualsModProofIrrelevancy. One can therefore not, for instance, use Terms in the EquivalenceDirectedGraph_\r\n- [x] There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the taclet rule base\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the deployment/CI infrastructure (gradle, github, ...)\r\n- [ ] Other: \r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n    \r\n- [x] I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments). _Old methods concerning equalsModRenaming logic have been moved to RenamingProperty.java. Some of them were not documented before and still are not. Other new code has been documented._\r\n- [ ] I made sure that new/changed end-user features are well documented (https://github.com/KeYProject/key-docs). _This should not affect the end-user_\r\n- [x] I added new test case(s) for new functionality. _As some of the equalsMod... methods were not tested before, I added new tests in the new test class TestEqualsModProperty_\r\n- [x] I have tested the feature as follows: _Above mentioned test cases_\r\n- [ ] I have checked that runtime performance has not deteriorated.\r\n\r\n<!-- Add further information to help the reviewer understand the

Intended Change\r\n\r\nThere was no explicit update function for sequences in KeY (any more). I added `seqUpd` for that purpose.\r\nThe axiomatic rules is in `seqRules.key` and essentially reads:\r\n\r\n     \\find(alpha::seqGet(seqUpd(seq, idx, value), jdx))\r\n     \\replacewith(\\if(0<=jdx & jdx < seqLen(seq) & idx=jdx) \\then((alpha)value) \\else(alpha::seqGet(seq, jdx)))\r\n\r\n* The JML translation was adapted\r\n* The JML in Java translation was extended and adapted\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n- [x] There are changes to the taclet rule base\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the deployment/CI infrastructure (gradle, github, ...)\r\n- [ ] Other: \r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n    \r\n- [ ] I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments). *The added code essentially copies similar code around it and has the same level of documentation.*\r\n- [ ] I made sure that new/changed end-user features are well documented (https://github.com/KeYProject/key-docs). *There is no documentation for \\seq to add to.*\r\n- [ ] I added new test case(s) for new functionality. *There are no test cases for the other similar seqXXX functions to which one would add new test cases.*\r\n- [x] I have tested the feature as follows: *by extending an existing case study in KeY*\r\n- [ ] I have checked that runtime performance has not deteriorated.\r\n\r\nThe contributions within this pull request are licensed under GPLv2 (only) for inclusion in

Intended Change\r\n\r\nThis is an overhaul of the `\\proofObligation` inside of KeY files and some internal api changes. \r\n\r\n1. `\\proofObligation` is migrated from a property string to the new configuration grammar. An entry looks as follows:\r\n```\r\n\\proofObligation { \r\n    \"class\" : \"de.uka.ilkd.key.proof.init.FunctionalOperationContractPO\",\r\n    \"contract\" : \"SITA3[SITA3::rearrange()].JML normal_behavior operation contract.0\",\r\n    \"name\" : \"SITA3[SITA3::rearrange()].JML normal_behavior operation contract.0\"\r\n }\r\n```\r\nEarlier it was a string holding the information as a `Properties`. This allows in feature to have type-safe PO parameters. This affects the grammar, parser and also the store functionality of each PO class. \r\n\r\n2. Renovation of `#loadFrom`. Old KeY uses the `class` information to load this class and invokes the static method `#loadFrom(...)`. This PR replaces this behaviour using the `ServiceLoader`. This makes adding a new PO (loader) more convenient and type-safe. \r\n\r\n\r\n**A fallback for old `\\proofObligation` is implemented.** Reading an old `\\proofObligation \"...\";` entry should be translated into the new architecture. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- **X** Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally change)\r\n\r\n- **X** Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- **X** There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n- **X** Other: KeY-Problem-Files, Grammar\r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n    \r\n- **X** I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n- **X** I made sure that new/changed end-user features are documented as well as before. \r\n- **X** I have tested the feature as follows: store a proof file\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-28T03:39:22Z","updated_at":"2024-05-06T17:38:38Z","closed_at":"2024-05-06T17:38:37Z","merged_at":"2024-05-06T17:38:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"66fc99f47d3c94fe5dbf37dada114bebc81cf78c","assignee":{"login":"wadoon","id":104259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wadoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"wadoon","id":104259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wadoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wadoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4940939276,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIpmSbc8AAAABJoDADA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/labels/Proof%20Loading/Saving","name":"Proof

project\n885ebff Move IDEUtil class to miglayout-core and delete obsolete ideutil project</p>\n<p>The IDEUtil class is used to expose package-private functionality from\nmiglayout-core to external projects.\nThis mechanism fails in an OSGi environment, because the IDEUtil class\nis loaded by a different classloader that is used to load classes it\ntries to access.</p>\n<p>To solve this problem, move IDEUtil to miglayout-core. Given that the\nideutil project is now empty, it is removed from the repository.</p>\n<p>resolves <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/mikaelgrev/miglayout/issues/103\">#103</a>\n4d12448 released 11.2</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mikaelgrev/miglayout/commit/6a57a8a55a0f6661cac48d75f08c62f765f16eed\"><code>6a57a8a</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/mikaelgrev/miglayout/issues/104\">#104</a> from ptziegler/issue103</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mikaelgrev/miglayout/commit/885ebff4deff128986550b0d093ecb443eabbcfe\"><code>885ebff</code></a> Move IDEUtil class to miglayout-core and delete obsolete ideutil project</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mikaelgrev/miglayout/commit/4d12448aa35f8b2e11c82b552f15cd16072697fd\"><code>4d12448</code></a> released 11.2</li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/mikaelgrev/miglayout/compare/v11.2...v11.3\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=com.miglayout:miglayout-swing&package-manager=gradle&previous-version=11.2&new-version=11.3)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
