[{"id":553,"iid":489,"project_id":15,"title":"JUnit 5","description":"This MR brings JUnit 5 to KeY, see #1674.\n\nIt includes a migration of existing JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 to JUnit 5, despite the backward-compatibility.\n\n**STATE:** Two parameterized JUnit 4 test cases are missing. \n\nJUnit 5 has several advantages to JUnit4:\n\n* it exploits lambdas for writing more readable tests. \n* `@TestFactory` allows to create a function which returns a sequence of test cases\n  ```java\n  @TestFactory Stream\u003cDynamicTest\u003e integerLiterals() {\n      return input.stream().map( it -\u003e DynamicTest.dynamicTest(it, () -\u003e test(it)));\n  }\n  ```\n* It has also a very simple parameterization with `@ParameterizedTest`:\n  ```java\n  @ParameterizedTest\n  @ValueSource(ints = {1, 3, 5, -3, 15, Integer.MAX_VALUE}) // six numbers\n  void isOdd_ShouldReturnTrueForOddNumbers(int number) {\n    assertTrue(Numbers.isOdd(number));\n  }\n  ```\n\n  You can use `@ValueSource`, `@CsvSource`, `@CsvSourceFile`, `@MethodSource`, or `@EnumSource`\n   See \u003chttps://www.baeldung.com/parameterized-tests-junit-5\u003e for more information.\n\n\n**`AutoSuite` is not required anymore.**","state":"merged","created_at":"2022-01-17T13:23:51.146Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T14:06:53.764Z","merged_by":{"id":7,"username":"weigl","public_email":"alexander.weigl@kit.edu","name":"Alexander

For example\n\n```\nclass Test {\n  //@ public instance model \\dl_int MY_INTEGER = 0;\n  //@ public instance ghost \\dl_heap A_HEAP;\n}\n```\n\nJavaDL types are treated as primitive types, and hence heap independent! Also, like every *primitive type* in KeY, each Java DL type requires a default value. In the latest version the default value for a sort is given in documentation comment on the sort itself. For example, the following definitions define the default value for `NatList` as `nil`.\n\n```\n\\sorts {\n    Nat;\n    /*!  @defaultValue(nil) */\n    NatList;\n}\n```\n\nThe resolution of default values are post-poned to `Recoder2KeYConverter`, because we require valid namespaces. Therefore, if recoder is queried for the default of a `\\dl_${TYPE}` it answered with an DL escape `\\dl_DEFAULT_VALUE_${TYPE}`. This DL escape is later special treated in the general conversion of `EscapedExpression` from recoder to KeY classes. \n\n\n### Smaller Additions\n\n* KeY-files, which are included in the loaded `KeYUserProblemFile`, are now processed before the Java is read and JML is parsed. This allows access to included symbols inside DL escapes in JML.\n\n* Like `Taclet`s, `Sort` also offers a documentation and an origin string. The documentation string is needed to give human readable explanation to the user (often given by an documentary comment inside a KeY-file) and also for useful additional meta-data. The origin string, a composition of url and line number, allows the user to find the source of sorts definitions directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n default it is currently defined as `\\dl_XXX_atom`. Similar to `\\atom` which is the default of `\\free`.\n\n:exclamation: This MR is urgently required for the bachelor thesis of Hannes Sowa.","state":"merged","created_at":"2021-12-24T22:18:20.881Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T14:07:18.147Z","merged_by":{"id":7,"username":"weigl","public_email":"alexander.weigl@kit.edu","name":"Alexander

#1651.","description":"Closes #1651.\n\nThis bug was a consequence of my fix in !440.\n\nWhile fixing it again, I also stumbled across another bug where after pruning a closed proof, it could not be closed again. The issue was the following: The one-step simplifier takes over some taclets, removing them from the taclet indices of all open goals. When the OSS is turned off or the user switches to another proof, these taclets are re-added to the indices of all open goals; then, when the user switches back to the original proof, the OSS takes them over again. The problem is the following:\n\n1. Load some example (proof a). The OSS takes over the relevant taclets and removes them from the index of the open goal. \n2. Close the proof.\n3. Switch to some other example (proof b). The OSS refreshes itself for proof b and tries to add the taken-over taclets to all open goals of proof a; but, since proof a is closed, there are no open goals.\n4. Switch back to proof a and prune it. Since the taken-over taclets have not been re-added, the OSS cannot taken them over again. Thus, the OSS is not available during the proof.\n\nI fixed this by removing and re-adding the taken-over taclets not just from all open goals, but also from all (open and closed) goals. @rbubel can you take a look at this?\n\nIf this branch fails the test suite and the fix turns out to be more complicated, another—less nice—fix would be to not allow pruning closed proofs.","state":"merged","created_at":"2021-12-20T17:47:28.267Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T17:59:09.619Z","merged_by":{"id":7,"username":"weigl","public_email":"alexander.weigl@kit.edu","name":"Alexander Weigl","state":"active","locked":false,"avatar_url":"https://git.key-project.org/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7/avatar.png","web_url":"https://git.key-project.org/weigl"},"merge_user":{"id":7,"username":"weigl","public_email":"alexander.weigl@kit.edu","name":"Alexander Weigl","state":"active","locked":false,"avatar_url":"https://git.key-project.org/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7/avatar.png","web_url":"https://git.key-project.org/weigl"},"merged_at":"2021-12-22T15:19:53.425Z","closed_by":null,"closed_at":null,"target_branch":"KeY-2.10.0","source_branch":"lanzingerFix1651","user_notes_count":15,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"author":{"id":36,"username":"lanzinger","public_email":"","name":"Florian Lanzinger","state":"active","locked":false,"avatar_url":null,"web_url":"https://git.key-project.org/lanzinger"},"assignees":[{"id":36,"username":"lanzinger","public_email":"","name":"Florian Lanzinger","state":"active","locked":false,"avatar_url":null,"web_url":"https://git.key-project.org/lanzinger"}],"assignee":{"id":36,"username":"lanzinger","public_email":"","name":"Florian Lanzinger","state":"active","locked":false,"avatar_url":null,"web_url":"https://git.key-project.org/lanzinger"},"reviewers":[{"id":2,"username":"rbubel","public_email":"","name":"Richard Bubel","state":"active","locked":false,"avatar_url":"https://git.key-project.org/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/2/avatar.png","web_url":"https://git.key-project.org/rbubel"}],"source_project_id":15,"target_project_id":15,"labels":["🐛 Bug"],"draft":false,"imported":false,"imported_from":"none","work_in_progress":false,"milestone":{"id":6,"iid":4,"project_id":15,"title":"v2.10.0","description":"The next major version after 2.8.0. \r\n\r\nWe decided the following in the KaKeY meetings:\r\n* feature freeze: November 15th\r\n* subsequently: testing by Hiwis\r\n* first week of December: testing and bug fixing event with staff\r\n* release date: shortly prior to christmas, such that it is available for teaching in formal methods course\r\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-07-24T18:39:26.522Z","updated_at":"2022-01-05T18:03:59.261Z","due_date":"2021-12-23","start_date":"2021-07-26","expired":true,"web_url":"https://git.key-project.org/key/key/-/milestones/4"},"merge_when_pipeline_succeeds":false,"merge_status":"can_be_merged","detailed_merge_status":"not_open","merge_after":null,"sha":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7b19341b86f3df313d8070d16ebb8b33f5bd508d","squash_commit_sha":null,"discussion_locked":null,"should_remove_source_branch":null,"force_remove_source_branch":true,"prepared_at":"2021-12-20T17:47:28.267Z","reference":"!461","references":{"short":"!461","relative":"!461","full":"key/key!461"},"web_url":"https://git.key-project.org/key/key/-/merge_requests/461","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"squash":false,"squash_on_merge":false,"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"has_conflicts":false,"blocking_discussions_resolved":true},{"id":524,"iid":460,"project_id":15,"title":"fixes #1650","description":"handling keyboard shortcuts raised error.

and disposes the resources like the taclet index used by the OSS. When you then prune that closed proof and try doing anything, a NPE will be thrown.\n\nThe fix was to not call `shutdownIndices()` in that case. Since we only have one OSS per Java profile, and the resources are disposed and re-initialized whenever the user switches proofs, I don't think maintaining these resources causes any memory

meeting](https://git.key-project.org/key/key/-/wikis/KaKey-2021-09-17). This provides nice syntax highlighting, a highlighting of the error location (now even with squiggly line), an \"Edit File\" action, clickable links in the error message which can be used to open a webpage (e.g., the classpath error links to https://key-project.org/docs/user/Classpath).\n\n![image](/uploads/e08d8e911fda799b236510171ad91af6/image.png)\n\n# Overview of all changes\n\n* Provides a better classpath error message (+ link to docs).\n* Removed explicit inclusion of position in this message of `BuildingException`. This problem led to wrong position in error messages, since the position has to be converted from 1-based to 0-based later on.\n* Deleted duplicate test class `de.uka.ilkd.key.rule.TestTacletBuild`.\n* Renamed `WarningsDialog` to `IssueDialog` and promoted it to the single dialog for all exceptions and warnings that may occur during parsing. The old `ExceptionDialog` is unused now (for the moment I just marked it as deprecated).\n* Error positions are highlighted with squiggly lines now.\n* Stacktrace is shown in a separate panel on demand, hidden by default (also requested in KaKeY).\n* Replaced further information button by clickable links directly in warning message (links are converted to html automatically)\n* Instead of opening the default text editor, the EditSourceFileAction is back (requested by @mulbrich). This has the benefit of placing the cursor directly at the problem location.

[unloadable.zproof](/uploads/d0fe0d71aee38d6c366cf07a58fdd209/unloadable.zproof) fails to load after !399 and loads again after this fix\n\n**Cause:**\n!399 translates `Throwable(String, Throwable)` in javaRedux into\n```\n   public Throwable(java.lang.String arg0, java.lang.Throwable arg1) {\n       //@ set message = arg0;\n       //@ set cause = arg1;\n       ;\n   }\n```\nOld/after fix:\n```\n

behavior was to create empty statements in `JMLTransformer.java` for `@set` annotations at the bottom of a method. But one for each comment, not one for all comments. Now, the same behavior is copied to `ProofJavaProgramFactory.java`. Sorry, I should have noticed this earlier.\n\nIn principle, it would be nice to remove all artificial `EmptyStatement`s. But to be compatible this fix even adds more empty statements.","state":"merged","created_at":"2021-09-16T18:41:50.037Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T14:07:46.128Z","merged_by":{"id":7,"username":"weigl","public_email":"alexander.weigl@kit.edu","name":"Alexander Weigl","state":"active","locked":false,"avatar_url":"https://git.key-project.org/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7/avatar.png","web_url":"https://git.key-project.org/weigl"},"merge_user":{"id":7,"username":"weigl","public_email":"alexander.weigl@kit.edu","name":"Alexander Weigl","state":"active","locked":false,"avatar_url":"https://git.key-project.org/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7/avatar.png","web_url":"https://git.key-project.org/weigl"},"merged_at":"2021-09-24T23:39:04.509Z","closed_by":null,"closed_at":null,"target_branch":"main","source_branch":"graetzFixSetAnnotatationProofloading","user_notes_count":2,"upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"author":{"id":69,"username":"lukas","public_email":"lukas.graetz@tu-darmstadt.de","name":"Lukas Grätz","state":"active","locked":false,"avatar_url":null,"web_url":"https://git.key-project.org/lukas"},"assignees":[{"id":69,"username":"lukas","public_email":"lukas.graetz@tu-darmstadt.de","name":"Lukas Grätz","state":"active","locked":false,"avatar_url":null,"web_url":"https://git.key-project.org/lukas"}],"assignee":{"id":69,"username":"lukas","public_email":"lukas.graetz@tu-darmstadt.de","name":"Lukas Grätz","state":"active","locked":false,"avatar_url":null,"web_url":"https://git.key-project.org/lukas"},"reviewers":[{"id":7,"username":"weigl","public_email":"alexander.weigl@kit.edu","name":"Alexander Weigl","state":"active","locked":false,"avatar_url":"https://git.key-project.org/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/7/avatar.png","web_url":"https://git.key-project.org/weigl"}],"source_project_id":15,"target_project_id":15,"labels":["Proof Loading/Saving","Review Request"],"draft":false,"imported":false,"imported_from":"none","work_in_progress":false,"milestone":{"id":6,"iid":4,"project_id":15,"title":"v2.10.0","description":"The next major version after 2.8.0. \r\n\r\nWe decided the following in the KaKeY meetings:\r\n* feature freeze: November 15th\r\n* subsequently: testing by Hiwis\r\n* first week of December: testing and bug fixing event with staff\r\n* release date: shortly prior to christmas, such that it is available for teaching in formal methods course\r\n","state":"closed","created_at":"2019-07-24T18:39:26.522Z","updated_at":"2022-01-05T18:03:59.261Z","due_date":"2021-12-23","start_date":"2021-07-26","expired":true,"web_url":"https://git.key-project.org/key/key/-/milestones/4"},"merge_when_pipeline_succeeds":false,"merge_status":"cannot_be_merged","detailed_merge_status":"not_open","merge_after":null,"sha":null,"merge_commit_sha":"852adb65a965cb11711484261768b68e295bac02","squash_commit_sha":"ffa1d1bd0ef6a60c34da1c2f9ce496c853673ec5","discussion_locked":null,"should_remove_source_branch":null,"force_remove_source_branch":true,"prepared_at":"2021-09-16T18:41:50.037Z","reference":"!401","references":{"short":"!401","relative":"!401","full":"key/key!401"},"web_url":"https://git.key-project.org/key/key/-/merge_requests/401","time_stats":{"time_estimate":0,"total_time_spent":0,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null},"squash":true,"squash_on_merge":true,"task_completion_status":{"count":0,"completed_count":0},"has_conflicts":true,"blocking_discussions_resolved":true},{"id":460,"iid":400,"project_id":15,"title":"Fix for #1582: Proofs not reloadable due to changed contract combination","description":"This MR provides a fix for #1582.

It was often told that this is a problem of the `recoder` library. But it is a problem of KeY, as the `recoder` is correctly delivering the JML statements as comments, and the post-processing in KeY in the buggy point. \n\n**Background:** KeY attaches the (JML) comments to AST node. In detail, KeY attaches a comment to the next AST node following the comment. This makes sense in various place: Loop contracts/invariants are attached to loops (mostly), JML statements are attached to the next statement. If there is not *next statement* or following AST node, the comment is attached to the root AST node (in most cases a compilation unit). \n\n**Change:** This MR changes the AST node resolution in the cases, where no next AST node could be resolved. If the comment is last in a StatementBlock, an *empty statement* is created to which the comment is attached. To keep the creation of empty statements to a minimum, some clearly non-JML comments are ignored. In all other cases, the old behavior is preserved.\n\nThis MR also brings **new test cases** to test the attachment algorithm explicitly.","state":"merged","created_at":"2021-09-12T00:57:16.989Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T14:07:47.879Z","merged_by":{"id":7,"username":"weigl","public_email":"alexander.weigl@kit.edu","name":"Alexander

Expanding and collapsing many nodes via the context menu is now much faster.\n\n# Performance improvements\nHere are some numbers for the proof of the contract of `eInsertionSort` from the [DualPivotQuickSort case study](https://www.key-project.org/2017/08/17/dual-pivot/), which has about 162k nodes (180k when also counting OSS nodes):\n|    action    | current master | tuned version (this branch) |\n|--------------|----------------|-----------------------------|\n| expand all   |       24s      |              ~1s            |\n| collapse all |       23s      |              ~1s            |\n\nHowever, the effect can also be observed clearly for example when expanding all nodes of the `SumAndMax` example.\n\n# Changes in effect of `expand/collapse below`\nDespite the name, the `expand/collapse below` actions currently also operated on all nodes of the same level. This is fixed now.\n\n# Refactoring of `ExpansionState` class\nThe class `ExpansionState` which is responsible for storing the expanded paths of `JTree`, had lots of legacy (Java before Generics) and unused code which has been cleaned up and is now also properly documented.\n\n# Changes and drawback\nSome profiling showed that most of the time when expanding/collapsing was consumed by lots and lots of TreeExpandedEvents that were sent to the TreeExpansionListeners. The proof tree has two of those: One is for redrawing, and the other one is for the `ExpansionState`, which holds a set to store exactly the expanded paths. While the latter one is quite fast, the former one itself performs queries to the `JTree` to determine the expanded paths. As a solution, the new implementation temporarily disables/unregisters all listeners expect the `ExpansionState` listener.\n\nAnother tuning is to set a constant row height (depending on the current font size), which avoid the need to determine the height of each individual row by its content, which should be ok for the proof tree, we only have text rows of equal height. This also greatly speeds up the rendering (even more in combination with the `largeModels` property of the `JTree`).\n\nThe drawback is that the `ExpansionState` class now is tailored a bit to our proof tree use case. In particular, if you would have another `JTree` with more TreeExpansionListeners, these would possibly not get all the necessary events. Therefore, the `ExpansionState` has been renamed to `ProofTreeExpansionState` for clarity.","state":"merged","created_at":"2021-08-02T18:00:58.099Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T14:07:55.133Z","merged_by":{"id":4,"username":"mulbrich","public_email":"","name":"Mattias

communication rework","description":"Note: Replaces !369. In contrast to the former, this MR still uses the solvers in interactive mode, and solves the synchronization problems by merging stderr and stdout of the external process, and also by avoiding to forcibly destroy pipe and process.\n\nWhen using an SMT solver from KeY, the solver is started as an external process.\nThe solvers are used in interactive mode. Problem, commands, output/result, and error messages are exchanged via stdin/stdout/stderr between KeY and the solvers.\n\nHowever, the current implementation is overly complicated and very difficult to debug.\nIn addition, the communication is not properly synchronized.\nThis sometimes leads to very annoying problems, for example:\nThe result of `get-proof` is not obtained completely before the solver process is destroyed. \n\nThis merge request provides a complete rework of the communication with external SMT solver processes to make it make it easier to debug and get rid of the occasionally occurring \"broken pipe\" and \"stream closed\" errors. Note: The counterexample generator also still works.\n\nWhat has been done:\n* stderr of external solver process is redirected to stdout now\n* extracted Pipe interface, kept legacy version of Pipe, introduced simpler one which does not spawn receiver threads (2 threads less per running solver instance!)\n* removed generics from SolverCommunication, Pipe, and ExternalProcessLauncher\n* adapted Z3Socket, Z3CESocket, CVC4Socket (other Sockets still need to be adapted)\n\nTODOs:\n* [x] store also solver input in SolverCommunication\n* [ ] ~~Check if it is necessary to forcibly destroy pipe and/or process, in case sending \"(exit)\" fails.~~\n* [x] move SMT comm classes to new separate package\n* [x] legacy translations (see also [KaKey-2021-07-09](https://git.key-project.org/key/key/-/wikis/KaKey-2021-07-09)):\n  - [ ] ~~Z3 legacy fails currently since proof production is disabled -\u003e implement SMT option for proof production?~~\n  - [x] Simplify is not available for download any more -\u003e drop support\n  - [x] Yices 1.x is also very old (Yices 2.x can not be used, since it does not support quantifiers) -\u003e drop support\n  - [x] CVC3 is also outdated -\u003e drop support\n* [ ] ~~solver specific information (e.g., input parameters, output handling) should be in a single location for each solver~~\n* [ ] ~~update supported versions of solvers (how are these determined?)~~\n\nNote: The points that are struck through need a larger rework of the current infrastructure and are thus postponed and moved to #1574.","state":"merged","created_at":"2021-07-09T00:46:24.613Z","updated_at":"2021-08-13T15:27:29.645Z","merged_by":{"id":4,"username":"mulbrich","public_email":"","name":"Mattias
