Currently, the set is hard coded and only contains `key` as the only enabled key. This means, that KeY accepts the following JML annotation texts:\r\n\r\n* `/*@ ...*/`\r\n* `/*+key@ ...*/`\r\n* `/*+key+openjml@ ...*/`\r\n\r\nbut ignores\r\n\r\n* `/*+openjml@ ...*/`\r\n* `/*-key@ ...*/`\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\n* This PR adds a new field to the `GeneralSettings` which contains a set of enabled keys.\r\n* You can set this field either by `-PJML_ENABLED_KEYS=a,b,c` on the CLI, or \r\n* via the `$HOME/.key/proofIndependentSettings.json`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no GUI element to configure this element. \r\n\r\n**The need** for this raises from case study where you want to have the same source code as the foundation, but you have different verification runs: e.g, functional behavior under overflow absence, and a second run to prove overflow absence. Now you can differentiate the specificaton between the runs. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n//+first@ assert x>0;\r\n//+second@ assume x>0;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Question to the reviewer \r\n\r\n* Should there be textbox in the settings dialog?\r\n* Should there be label in the status bar stating the current enabled keys?\r\n\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- *X* New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- *X* There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n- *X* Changes to the settings

Motivation \r\n\r\nThe `experimental` flag is a bad idea. You cannot control which feature you want to activate.\r\nInstead, you are getting a full load of functionality one activated. This PR allows you to have more fine-grained feature flags, with a well-defined backward behavior for `--experimental`. \r\n\r\nThis PR was created for #3022 to activate the labels w/o activated all of the other untested functions. \r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\n* A new settings `FeatureSettings` which is basically a set string (features to be activated)\r\n* A set of feature flags in places where `Main.isExperimentalMode()` were requested.\r\n* A settings panel \r\n  ![image](https://github.com/KeYProject/key/assets/104259/5241ad06-6aa0-4c27-a246-483902a2824f)\r\n* A behavior for `--experimental`, activating all features.\r\n* Feature flags are stored and read in the proof-independent settings\r\n* Changes in feature flags can have an effect depending on the feature \r\n\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n- [x] Other: The effect of CLI parameter `--experimental`. \r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n    \r\n- [x] I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n\r\nThe contributions within this pull request are licensed under GPLv2 (only) for inclusion in

The comments may remain since they will be\r\ninvisible when showing the PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Related Issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Please remove if this PR is not related to an issue. -->\r\n<!-- Please add number if it is in answer to an issue. -->\r\nThis pull request addresses #3367 \r\n\r\nThe PR is an addition to the immediate bug fix PR #3368. It adds a new feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\nIt removes some information from the GUIProofTreeModel that was kept redundant and only used for restoring the view state after proof switching.\r\n\r\nThe proof tree view states are now exported and saved explicitly thus allowing to also restore the filter settings on a per proof basis.\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally change)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the taclet rule base\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the deployment/CI infrastructure (gradle, github, ...)\r\n- [ ] Other: \r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n    \r\n- [X] I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n- [ ] I made sure that new/changed end-user features are well documented (https://github.com/KeYProject/key-docs).\r\n- [ ] I added new test case(s) for new functionality.\r\n- [X] I have tested the feature as follows: Opened different proofs with different filter settings and switching between them\r\n- [ ] I have checked that runtime performance has not deteriorated.\r\n\r\n## Additional information and contact(s)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contributions within this pull request are licensed under GPLv2 (only) for inclusion in

The redundant information was seemingly only thought to be used to store the selected node when switching proofs and restoring it when switching back. The method setFilter should for that reason not query the model for the selection but the view to get an up-to-date path.\r\n\r\nPreviously it got null (despite a node being selected in the view) and  did not activate the filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief description of what behaviour changes and \r\n     why it should be changed. -->\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Playing around with multiple proofs and selecting filters seems to work.\r\n- [ ] I have checked that runtime performance has not deteriorated.\r\n\r\n## Additional information and

pull request allows handling various aliases for frame conditions within method/block/loop contracts and loop specifications. These aliases cover the ones which are used in various other verification tools with contracts for Java-like programs, e.g., Krakatoa, OpenJML, Dafny, ACSL++, or CorC.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the following aliases are henceforth supported for frame conditions in method, block, and loop contracts as well as loop specifications:\r\n\r\n`assignable`, *`assigns`*, *`assigning`*, `modifiable`, *`modifies`*, *`modifying`*, `writable`, *`writes`*, *`writing`*.\r\n\r\nUpon usage of the italic versions, we throw a warning in order to distinguish expected semantics, e.g., from runtime verification, as KeY does static analysis, but (other than potentially seeing a warning) these versions are supported in the same way as the other aliases.\r\n\r\nFor loop specifications, we also support the respective aliases with the prefix `loop_`.\r\n\r\nDuring discussions on this pull request, it was noted that the semantics implemented within KeY might be better captured by `modifiable`, but for legacy reasons, we do not move away from (also) using `assignable`.\r\n\r\n## Related Issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Please remove if this PR is not related to an issue. -->\r\n<!-- Please add number if it is in answer to an issue. -->\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses #3362.\r\n\r\n## Intended Change\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief description of what behavior changes and \r\n     why it should be changed. -->\r\nThis pull request introduces the aliases for frame conditions which are shown above. Thereby, it increases compatibility with further tools using JML, JML variants, or JML-alikes, such as Krakatoa, OpenJML, Dafny, or ACSL++.\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in the box(es) that apply: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (behavior should not change or only minimally change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the taclet rule base\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the deployment/CI infrastructure (gradle, github, ...)\r\n- [ ] Other: \r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n    \r\n- [ ] I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (Javadoc and inline comments).\r\n- [ ] I made sure that new/changed end-user features are well documented (https://github.com/KeYProject/key-docs).\r\n- [ ] I added new test case(s) for new functionality.\r\n- [x] I have tested the feature as follows: Checked it for the example from the referenced issue.\r\n- [ ] I have checked that runtime performance has not deteriorated.\r\n\r\n## Additional information and contact(s)\r\n\r\nSome of the changes are results from work at the HacKeYthon together with @unp1.\r\nThe contributions within this pull request are licensed under GPLv2 (only) for inclusion in

We extract common data structures to `ncore` and took Feedback from the KaDa meetings into consideration. It does not break existing functionality and should be merged as otherwise maintaining a parallel version becomes difficult.\r\n\r\n## Type of pull request\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in the box(es) that apply: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Refactoring (behaviour should not change or only minimally change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] There are changes to the (Java) code\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the taclet rule base\r\n- [ ] There are changes to the deployment/CI infrastructure (gradle, github, ...)\r\n- [ ] Other: \r\n\r\n## Ensuring quality\r\n    \r\n- [x] I made sure that introduced/changed code is well documented (javadoc and inline comments).\r\n- [x] I made sure that new/changed end-user features are well documented (https://github.com/KeYProject/key-docs).\r\n- [ ] I added new test case(s) for new functionality.\r\n- [ ] I have tested the feature as follows: ...\r\n- [ ] I have checked that runtime performance has not deteriorated.\r\n\r\n## Additional information and contact(s)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent developers not involved in modularization can continue as usual with the following restrictions:\r\n1. Changes in `ncore` must be discussed with the core developers and inparticular @Drodt.\r\n2. PRs with changes to `de.uka.ilkd.logic.*` should always add @Drodt  as an additional reviewer.\r\n3.

#3254 \r\nTo prevent name clashes with bound variables, the free variables in the update and the bound variables of a formula are compared.\r\nIn case of a clash, the bound variable is renamed and a substitution is performed on the subterms of the formula automatically before applying the update.\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://github.com/KeYProject/key/assets/93993502/7bac8d57-a908-4902-ad00-fd5a10cae837)\r\nnow

So if the different meanings of ```a1``` in this situation are still of concern, it might be needed to find a solution on a higher level than ApplyUpdateOnRigidCondition, e.g. when

commit factors out pruning, saving and reference resolving functionality to reduce the dependencies of Proof and to make it later easier to realise correct synchronization as well as saving proofs.\r\n\r\nNot for this PR, but we should have a discussion about what our proof object should have as basic data structure. My idea:\r\n- merge references and linked goals to once concept independent of merge rule or proof caching\r\n- allow to register reference resolvers that can deal with references\r\n- ask before saving (in the GUI) if references should be resolved\r\n  - if yes, resolve and then pass the proof to the `OutputStreamProofSaver`\r\n  - if not, the proof is passed to `OutputStreamProofSaver` which just saves the references (and does not resolve)\r\n  - this allows to remove the line \r\n        `CopyReferenceResolver.copyCachedGoals(proof, null, null, null);`\r\n   from `OutputStreamProofSaver`. As the saver should not have specific knowledge and it should not change the proof object while saving\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-10T09:56:41Z","updated_at":"2023-11-19T22:54:48Z","closed_at":"2023-11-19T22:54:48Z","merged_at":"2023-11-19T22:54:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f7ed58099f225992b4635a09da40e9369a9e8f9","assignee":{"login":"unp1","id":8257939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTc5Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8257939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1","html_url":"https://github.com/unp1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"unp1","id":8257939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTc5Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8257939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1","html_url":"https://github.com/unp1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4940995779,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIpmSbc8AAAABJoGcww","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/labels/%F0%9F%9B%A0%20Maintenance","name":"🛠 Maintenance","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":"Code quality and related things w/o functional changes"},{"id":5454055738,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIpmSbc8AAAABRRZJOg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/labels/Java","name":"Java","color":"ffa221","default":false,"description":"Pull requests that update Java code"},{"id":6011812077,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIpmSbc8AAAABZlT47Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/labels/Ignore%20in%20Changelog","name":"Ignore in Changelog","color":"D4C5F9","default":false,"description":"If given, a PR will not be considered for Changelog generation.

these changes out from PR #3335 to keep the PRs more focused\r\n\r\nOverall:\r\n- Reduce unnecessary event propagation and handling during automode\r\n- TaskTree unregisters properly during automode\r\n- Remove GUI specific functionality from KeYMediator (DelayCut behavior) to the corresponding action object. \r\n\r\nKeYSelectionModel\r\n- Consistent state of KeYMediator and its selection model\r\n- Reduction in duplicate selection events\r\n- Clearer flow of information\r\n\r\nProofTreeView:\r\n- Remove RuleAppListener\r\n-- RuleAppListener should only be used by prover internal entitied that are required for the proof search.\r\n    Others should not use it or listen for autoModeStarted events and unregister. ProofTreeView did not need to be a rule app listener, so this could be removed completely.\r\n\r\nAdditional synchronizations to fix that quick random clicks on start/stop caused exceptions and/or deadlocks.\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-07T17:12:45Z","updated_at":"2023-11-10T11:59:48Z","closed_at":"2023-11-10T11:59:47Z","merged_at":"2023-11-10T11:59:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"ae6eface4142f11e8690b0c89b2cdf8ab78d7f96","assignee":{"login":"unp1","id":8257939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTc5Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8257939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1","html_url":"https://github.com/unp1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"unp1","id":8257939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTc5Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8257939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1","html_url":"https://github.com/unp1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unp1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4940995779,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIpmSbc8AAAABJoGcww","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/labels/%F0%9F%9B%A0%20Maintenance","name":"🛠 Maintenance","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":"Code quality and related things w/o functional changes"},{"id":6011812077,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIpmSbc8AAAABZlT47Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KeYProject/key/labels/Ignore%20in%20Changelog","name":"Ignore in Changelog","color":"D4C5F9","default":false,"description":"If given, a PR will not be considered for Changelog generation.

PR allows to fully disable origin label creation if tracking is disabled. Switching tracking of an reloading, does no longer introduce origin labels in the first place.\r\n\r\n- OriginLabels are only created via OriginTermLabelFactory\r\n- Services have an OriginTermLabelFactory\r\n- TermBuilder adds origin labels only when services has a factory set\r\n- Changing origin tracking requires reloading\r\n- Proof object no longer depends on origin labels \r\n- Proof object no longer responsible for source view related initialization of relevant files (moved to source view)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following should be considered for the midterm, but should not be a blocker for merging this PR:\r\n- remove hard coded OriginLabel knowledge from services, termbuilder etc. and provide a more general framework (this item can also be postponed)\r\n\r\n@Reviewers:\r\n- any idea how to pass knowledge about origin tracking to the PreParser in a nicer manner?\r\n\r\nFixes #3315 \r\n

PR is an alternative to #3272, it only includes the optimizations. See the commits in this branch for details. Short description of each optimization:\r\n\r\n- replaceKnown is called only on the changed sub-term, does not rescan entire term\r\n- term replacement key hashcode uses depth() and op()\r\n- cycle check switches to set implementation if >30 steps are done\r\n- configurable cycle check and protocol (default: enabled, same as previous state)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR fixes a bug with the construction of replaceKnown taclet apps inside the OSS. They were horribly broken before.\r\n\r\nIn the table below, I have benchmarked the optimizations on [ShortestPath.java](https://gist.github.com/FliegendeWurst/9be15e20e3bfd0722fcdd7f5c4afebcd) (Finish Symbolic Execution).\r\n\r\n| Description                   | Nodes | Rule apps | Time |\r\n:------------------------------:|:-----:|:---------:|:-----:\r\nBaseline                        | 2568  | 10,521    | 18.8s\r\nAll optimizations | 2581 | 10,537 | 16.2s (-13%)\r\n\r\nThe number of rule apps and nodes is different, but that's just because KeY's strategy is not deterministic.\r\n\r\nMore proofs (Benchmark: strategy)\r\n\r\n| Proof | Baseline | This PR\r\n:-:|:-:|:-:\r\nBinary Search | 2.281s | 2.312s\r\nSITA | 0.586s, 2.587s, 0.153s | 0.588s, 2.556, 0.153s\r\nSumAndMax | 1.72s | 1.83s\r\nRemoveDup | 0.649s, 0.208s, 6.221s | 0.649s, 0.221s, 6.203s\r\nSaddleback (no OSS) | 42.0s | 41.7s\r\nSaddleback (OSS) | 46.3s | 46.4s\r\n\r\nOverall: 0.1%

PR fixes #3248 and supersedes #3256 and #3257 by optimizing the One Step Simplifier in several ways. See the commits in this branch for details.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the following rules are added to a new `oss` ruleset included in the OSS:\r\n\r\n- selectOfStore, selectOfCreate, selectOfAnon, selectOfMemset, selectCreatedOfAnon, dismissNonSelectedField\r\n- elementOfUnion, elementOfArrayRange (elementOfSingleton and similar could also be useful)\r\n- sortsDisjointModuloNull\r\n- ifthenelse_negated\r\n- castDel\r\n\r\nThis means that the One Step Simplifier can now simplify many heap terms in a single step. Previously this required many more proof nodes. For the file linked below, this additional ruleset is required (see https://github.com/KeYProject/key/issues/3248#issuecomment-1704775679). The ruleset is handled specially in the Simplifier so it will not be applied inside a Quantifier, seqDef Function or UpdateJunctor (essentially it should only simplify heap selects where every parameter is known).\r\n\r\nSee #3280 for benchmarks on the optimizations.\r\n\r\nWhen adding the new rules, the OSS can do much more, but does not need much more time. Thanks to the optimization of the cycle check, its impact is not very high.\r\n| Description                   | Nodes | Rule apps | Time |\r\n:------------------------------:|:-----:|:---------:|:-----:\r\nwith new rules                  | 2229  | 98,473   | 33.5s\r\nwith new rules (no cycle check) | 2229  | 98,473   | 32.0s\r\n\r\ncc

creation of useful changelog are currently a huge pain. Github allows the creation of changelogs. It also supports categories based on PR labels if we configure it. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds such configuration. \r\n\r\nBut now we need to come up with a labeling which suits our needs. This PR is also the place for clean-up our labeling structure. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion would like to have really abstract categories, like (Core, UI, Proof Scripts, Extensions, ...), and then kinds like `added`, `fixed`, `open`.
